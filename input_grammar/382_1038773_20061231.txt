Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Forward Looking Statements Managements discussion of the Company and managements analysis of the Companys operations and prospects, and other matters, may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other provisions of applicable federal and state securities laws. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying such forward looking statements contained in this Report are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate. The use of such words as expect, anticipate, forecast, and comparable terms should be understood by the reader to indicate that the statement is forward looking and thus subject to change in a manner that can be unpredictable. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results anticipated, but not guaranteed, in this report, include (without limitation) economic and social conditions, competition for loans, mortgages, and other financial services and products, changes in interest rates, unforeseen changes in liquidity, results of operations, and financial conditions affecting the Companys customers, and other risks that cannot be accurately quantified or completely identified. Many factors affecting the Companys financial condition and profitability, including changes in economic conditions, the volatility of interest rates, political events and competition from other providers of financial services simply cannot be predicted. Because these factors are unpredictable and beyond the Companys control, earnings may fluctuate from period to 16 period. The purpose of this type of information is to provide readers with information relevant to understanding and assessing the financial condition and results of operations of the Company, and not to predict the future or to guarantee results. The Company is unable to predict the types of circumstances, conditions and factors that can cause anticipated results to change. The Company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect the occurrence of changes or unanticipated events, circumstances, or results. Managements Discussion And Analysis Or Plan Of Operation General The following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2006. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. Summary The Companys net income increased to $5,811,600 for 2006 compared to $4,324,519 for 2005 and $2,571,083 in 2004. The increase in net income represents a 34.3% increase from 2005 to 2006 and a 68.2% increase from 2004 to 2005. Net income per common share increased to $.90 for 2006 compared to $.71 for 2005 and $.52 for 2004. The increase in net income per common share from 2005 to 2006 was 26.7% and a 36.5% from 2004 to 2005. Pretax income was $9,139,123, $6,881,135 and $4,163,583 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This represents a 32.8% increase from 2005 to 2006 and a 65.2% increase from 2004 to 2005. The increase in net income per common share in 2006, 2005 and 2004 results directly from the dramatic growth of the Companys earning assets. This growth coupled with repetitive loan and security repricing as the Federal Reserve increased the target Federal Funds rate throughout each of these years helped the Company realize an increase of $4,258,407 or 29.1% increase in net interest income from 2005 to 2006 and $4,110,866 or 39.2% increase from 2004 to 2005. Also contributing to improved net income was an increase in non interest income of 10.8% from 2005 to 2006 and 35.5% from 2004 to 2005. Most of the increase was due to operating lease income, a new product line the Bank introduced in 2004, and the sale of commercial loans to conduit lenders. As the Bank continued to grow its loan portfolio at a rapid pace, the loan loss provision amounted to $1,106,000 in 2006, $1,401,600 in 2005 and $840,000 in 2004. Non interest expense increased 3 0.4% in 2006, 19.3% in 2005 and 20.1% in 2004. The majority of the increases were attributable to additional salaries and benefits as the Bank continued to increase the number of relationship mangers and support staff as well as the addition of depreciation expense associated with leased assets. Business of the Company The Companys earnings depend primarily on the Banks and Eagles net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income it receives from its assets (primarily its loans and investment securities) and the interest expense (or cost of funds) which it pays on its liabilities (primarily its deposits). Net interest income is a function of (i) the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (the interest rate spread or net interest spread) and (ii) the relative amounts of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. When interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company adheres to an asset and liability management strategy, which is intended to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations upon the Companys earnings and to make the yields on the Banks loan portfolio and investment securities and Eagles receivable financing more responsive to its cost of funds. This is accomplished by more closely matching the maturities of its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities, while still maximizing net interest income. Nevertheless, the Company is and will continue to be affected by changes in the levels of interest rates and other factors beyond its control. Unless specifically noted below, the following information is presented on a consolidated basis reflecting the Companys performance as a whole. The Companys results of operations are dependent primarily upon the results of operations of the Bank and Eagle. 17 For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Companys weighted average rate earned on all interest earning assets was 8.98%, 7.68% and 6.73% respectively. Conversely, the Companys weighted average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities for the same years was 3.82%, 2.75% and 2.03%, respectively. The Companys interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was 5.16%, 4.93% and 4.70% respectively. The net interest income for the same period of time was $18,852,697, $14,594,290 and $10,483,424, respectively. For fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded net income of $5,811,600 or $0.90 basic earnings per common share as compared with net income of $4,324,519 or $0.71 basic earnings per common share for fiscal year 2005 and net income of $2,571,083 or $0.52 basic earnings per common share for fiscal year 2004. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 the Bank was abl e to increase net income due to an increase in the Banks net interest income of 29.1%, 39.2% and 29.1%, respectively. During same period of time the Bank was able to control non interest expense with increases of 30.4%, 19.3% and 19.9%, respectively. Results of Operations Net Interest Income. Net interest income is the principal component of a financial institutions income stream and represents the spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on liabilities. The following discussion is on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income before loan loss provision increased by $4,258,407, $4,110,866 and $2,367,805 for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004. This represents an increase of 29.2%, 39.2% and 29.2% respectively. The increase in net interest income during these years is due to material growth of the balance sheet and the interest rate sensitivity of the Banks assets compared to its liabilities. This was a favorable position to take advantage of the rapid and predictable increases due to the Banks loan and security portfolios being mostly variable rate instruments. Loan origination fees continued to remain strong as the Bank became more proficient at Small Business Administration (SBA) lending and asset based lending. The Bank anticipates loan growth to continue along with loan origination fees. Interest expense increased 69.6%, 70.0% and 11.4% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cornerstone funded the rapid asset growth primarily with certificates of deposit and money market deposits which are typically more expensive for new deposits while retaining existing deposits. Interest income increased $8,486,724, $6,613,367 and $2,732,297 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase as a percentage was 41.0% in 2006 when compared to 2005 and 47.0% when comparing 2005 to 2004. Interest income produced by the loan portfolio increased $7,963,262 or 41.2% in 2006 compared to 2005 and $6,323,768 or 48.5% from 2005 to 2004. Interest income on investment securities and Federal Funds sold increased slightly at $523,462 or 39.71% in 2006 when compared to 2005 and $289,599 or 28.2% when comparing 2005 to 2004. The increases in loan interest income were due to a large increase in the volume and rate of loans as the portfolio grew, and was increased further by loan origination fees and servicing fees generated by the origination of SBA loans. The Bank attributes the strong loan growth to an increase in the number of relationship managers and their level of expertise. The small securities income increase was due to the g enerally higher interest rate environment, which presented few opportunities to invest without material interest rate risk exposure. Total interest expense increased $4,228,317 or 69.6% in 2006 when compared to 2005 and $2,502, 501 or 70.0% when comparing 2005 to 2004. One of the most useful tools for measuring the ability of a community bank to make money is its ability to maximize its net interest margin and its interest rate spread. The net interest margin, or the net yield on earning assets, is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. This ratio represents the difference between the average yield on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets. The Companys net interest margin for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 5.81%, 5.43% and 5.02%, respectively. The net interest spread, defined as the rate of interest income minus the rate of interest expense was 5.16%, 4.93%, and 4.70% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The yield on earning assets during the same time period was 8.98%, 7.68% and 6.73%, respectively. Allowance for Loan Loss. The allowance for possible loan loss represents managements assessment of the risks associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. Management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses and the appropriate provisions required to maintain a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated loan losses. Management believes that the allowance for possible loan losses balances of $4,258,352, and $3,545,042 for the years ending 2006 and 2005 were sufficient to absorb known credit risks in the portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic 18 circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio and require greater provisions for possible loan losses in the future. Non performing Assets. Non performing assets include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate held for sale. Non performing loans include loans classified as non accrual or renegotiated. Cornerstones policy is to place a loan on non accrual status when it is contractually past due 90 days or more as to payment of principal or interest. At the time a loan is placed on non accrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected may be reversed and charged against current earnings. Recognition of any interest after a loan has been placed on non accrual status is accounted for on a cash basis. For the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005 the Company had $1,482,833 and $1,731,383 of non performing assets, respectively. Non interest Income. Non interest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities including fee based services and profits and commissions earned through credit life insurance sales and other activities. In addition, gains or losses realized from the sale of investment securities are included in non interest income. Total non interest income increased by $206,536 in 2006 when compared to 2005 and $498,844 in 2005 when compared to 2004. This represents an increase of 10.8% from 2005 to 2006 and an increase of 35.5% from 2004 to 2005. Fee income from service charges on deposit accounts increased $313,956, $84,872 and $10,408 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Bank had no security gains in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Non interest Expense. Non interest expense increased by $2,501,955 and $1,330,558 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The change from 2005 to 2006 amounted to a 30.5% increase while the change from 2004 to 2005 represents a 19.3% increase. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1,515,709, $602,405 and $575,035 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change represents an increase of 33.6% from 2005 to 2006 and an increase of 15.4% from 2004 to 2005. These increases primarily resulted from the hiring of additional personnel to cover the growth of the Bank. Occupancy expense increased 25.1% in 2006, 12.0% in 2005 and 12.2% in 2004 as the Bank continued to operate five full service branches and update equipment. Other non interest expense increased $904,951 or 36.6% in 2006 and $443,055 or 21.8% in 2005. This increase was primarily related to data processing and other expenses incurred in connection with the Banks growth. Financial Condition Earning Assets. Average earning assets increased $56.1 million or 20.85% in 2006 and $59.3 or 28.3% in 2005. The increase in average earnings assets can be attributed to the increase in the Banks loan portfolio. This loan growth led the expansion of the balance sheet and the Bank funded the loan growth with a combination of FHLB borrowings, money market deposits and certificates of deposit. The average security portfolio grew $6.5 million or 21.9% in 2006 and $2.6 million or 9.6% in 2005 to maintain an appropriate amount of securities for pledging purposes and liquidity. Loan Portfolio. The Banks average loans were $284.1 million and $236.3 million for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. The percentage change in the average loan balance for 2006 was an increase of 20.2% and an increase of 30.3% for 2005. The actual balance, before the loan loss allowance, at the end of 2006 and 2005 was $310.1 million and $265.6 million. This represents an increase of $44.5 million when comparing the 2005 balance to the 2006 balance and $60.3 million when comparing the 2004 balance to the 2005 balance. Loan growth for 2005 and 2006 was evenly weighted throughout these years with several large, high quality loans greatly increasing the Banks outstanding balances. The growth was concentrated in commercial and commercial real estate. The Bank hired additional relationship mangers during 2006 in an effort to continue the Banks growth. The Bank feels strongly that the key to success in lending, as well as for the Bank as a whole, is to hire talented employees to provide outstanding customer service in a safe and sound manner. Investment Securities. Cornerstones average investment securities portfolio increased $6.5 million from 2005 to 2006 and $2.6 million from 2004 to 2005. At the same time Federal Funds increased $1.7 million in 2006 and $1.8 million in 2005. The average investment portfolio and average federal funds sold for 2006 was $40.9 million and $32.7 million in 2005. Cornerstone maintains an investment strategy of seeking portfolio yields within acceptable risk levels as well as providing liquidity, pledging requirements and GAP management. To accomplish these strategies, the Bank positioned the Investment Portfolio on the assumption that there was a higher probability of rates continuing to rise, and as a result took a cautious interest rate stance and invested appropriately. The majority of the purchases during 2006 were in US Agency callable notes structured with an interest rate cushion to protect the Bank if interest rates continue to r ise. The Bank allowed its US Agency LIBOR floaters to be called as 19 rates increased during 2006 without replacing them, as the agency U.S. Agency callable securities represented a better value due to the compressed spreads on the LIBOR floaters and scarcity of the security. Cornerstone maintains two classifications of investment securities: Held to Maturity and Available for Sale. The Available for Sale securities are carried at fair market value, whereas Held to Maturity securities are carried at book value. As of year end 2006 and 2005 the unrealized losses in the Available for Sale portfolio amounted to $174,457 and $341,466, respectively. Intangibles. During 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Statement No. 142 Goodwill and other Intangible Assets concerning the $2,541,476 goodwill created by the merger with the Bank of East Ridge. Goodwill and is tested annually for impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the fair value, a write down is recorded. No impairment loss was recognized during 2006, 2005 or 2004. Also, in December, 2005, the Company completed the purchase of Eagle Financial, Inc. and recorded an intangible asset of 848,916. Amortization expense relating to this intangible for 2006 and 2005 was $345,388 and $13,500, respectively. Deposits. Cornerstones average deposits increased $46 million or 21.2% and $43.5 million or 25.2% during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total actual deposits increased $23.3 million or 9.26% in 2006 when compared to 2005 and $64.6 million or 34.4% when comparing 2005 to 2004. The Banks deposit strategy continues to be focused on attracting transaction deposits from business customers while filling funding gaps with certificate of deposit specials to attract incremental funds while not driving up the cost of certificates already on the books. The Bank saw extraordinary success during these years in attracting business and public deposits to the Bank. Average interest bearing transaction accounts increased 24% in 2006 and 25% in 2005. Furthermore, average demand deposits increased 6.7% and 24.4% in 2006 and 2005. This success partially funded the Banks loan growth and allowed the Bank to maintain its net interest margin at an above peer bank level. The Bank expects to continue its focus on attracting deposits from businesses, especially transaction accounts, which are less expensive and tie the customer base closely to the Bank. Capital Resources. Stockholders average equity increased $6.8 million or 23.7% in 2006 and increased $10.3 million or 55.4% in 2005. The Company had net income of $5,811,600 in 2006, $4,324,519 in 2005 and $2,571,093 in 2004. The actual balance of stockholders equity increased $5.7 million or 17.6% in 2006 and $7.7 million or 30.9% in 2005. During 2005, the Company completed the 500,000 shares initial offering that began at the end of 2004 and represented approximately $7 million in additional capital. Also during 2005, several directors exercised non qualified options adding an additional $2.2 million to the Companys capital. In December 2006, the Company completed a 2 for 1 stock split increasing the number of outstanding common shares from 3,200,863 as of year end 2005 to a total of 6,511,848 at year end 2006. The Board of Directors decided they preferred for the stock price to remain in the historic range of $15 to $30. During the first quarter of 2007 the Companys stock has traded between $15 and $17 per share on the OTC Bulletin Board.

These loan committees enforce loan authorizations for each officer, makes lending decisions on loans exceeding such limits, services all requests for officer credits to the extent allowable under current laws and regulations, administers all problem credits, and determines the allocation of funds for each lending category. The Banks established maximum loan volume to assets is 85%. The loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate, commercial and installment loans. General At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Companys loan portfolio constituted approximately 81.5% and 81.0% of the Companys total assets, respectively. When broken down by subsidiary the loan portfolio constituted approximately 82.1% and 82.9% for the Bank, and 87.1% and 76.7% for Eagle for 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Commercial loans consist of loans and lines of credit to individuals, partnerships and corporations for a variety of business purposes, such as accounts receivable and inventory financing, equipment financing, business expansion and working capital. The terms of the Banks commercial loans generally range from 90 days to a 15 year amortization with a five year balloon. The loans generally carry interest rates, which adjust in accordance with changes in the prime rate, but when appropriate will be fixed to match the borrowers needs. Substantially all of the Banks commercial loans are secured and are guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. T his is the fastest growing area of the loan portfolio and is being staffed to continue this trend. The Bank believes this area has the best potential for future growth and has the highest barriers of entry to our competitors. Loans secured by marketable equipment are required to be amortized over a period not to exceed 60 months. Generally, loans secured by current assets such as inventory or accounts receivable are structured as revolving lines of credit with annual maturities. Loans secured by chattel mortgages and accounts receivable may not exceed 85% of their market value. Loans secured by listed stocks, municipal bonds and mutual funds may not exceed 70% of their market value. Unsecured short term loans and lines of credit must meet criteria set by the Banks Loan Committee. Current financial statements support all commercial loans, and such financial statements are updated annually. Commercial loans, which are considered small business loans, are the core business of the Bank. Most loans are made with a long term relationship intended and the Bank also seeks to obtain the borrowers business and personal depository accounts. Real Estate Construction Loans As of December 31, 2006, Cornerstone had $57.6 million in construction and development loans outstanding, which represented 18.6%% of the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2005 the amount in construction and development loans totaled $47.1 million or 17.7% of the loan portfolio. All construction and development loans are held in the Banks loan portfolio. The Bank makes residential construction loans to owner occupants and to persons building residential properties for resale. The Bank has two main areas of construction loans: one is to residential real estate developers for speculative or custom single family residential properties, and the other is to custom commercial construction projects with guaranteed takeout provisions. Construction loans are usually variable rate loans made for terms of one year or less, but extensions are permitted if construction has continued satisfactorily and if the loan is current and other circumstances w arrant the extension. Construction loans are limited to 80% of the appraised value of the lot and the completed value of the proposed structure. Construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than permanent mortgage financing of residential properties, and this additional risk usually is reflected in higher interest rates. The higher risk of loss on construction loans is attributable in large part to the fact that loan funds are estimated and advanced upon the security of the project under construction, which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of 24 construction. Moreover, because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, delays arising from labor problems, material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies, it is relatively difficult to accurately evaluate the total loan funds required to complete a project and to accurately evaluate the related loan to value ratios. If the estimates of construction costs and the saleability of the property upon completion of the project prove to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. The Banks underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risk of each construction loan. Among other items, the Bank considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing or a take out commitment to the borrower, the financial strength and reputation of the borrower, an independent appraisal and review of cost estimates, market conditions, and, if applicable, the amount of the borrowers equity in the project, pre construction sale or leasing information and cash flow projections of the borrower. Real Estate Mortgage Loans At December 31, 2006 and 2005, real estate mortgage loans totaled $48.7 million or 15.7% and $45.6 million or 17.2% of the Companys loan portfolio, respectively. Real estate mortgage loans include all one to four family residential loans secured by real estate for purposes other than construction or acquisition and development. All real estate loans are held in the Banks loan portfolio except for loans that are designated as loans held for sale. The loans held for sale are FHLB or FNMA qualified and have been pre approved by an underwriting specialist prior to closing. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bank held $701 thousand and $603 thousand of these secondary market mortgages, respectively. The remainder of the Banks mortgage loans are home equity loans and are made at fixed interest rates for terms of one to three years with balloon payment provisions and amortized over a 10 to 15 year period. The Banks experien ce indicates that real estate loans normally remain outstanding for much shorter periods (seven years on average) than their stated maturity because the borrowers repay the loans in full either upon the sale of the secured property or upon the refinancing of the original loan. In the case of owner occupied single family residences, real estate loans are made for up to 95% of the value of the property securing the loan, based upon an appraisal if the loan amount is over $100,000. When the loan is secured by real estate containing a non owner occupied dwelling of one to four family units, loans generally are made for up to 80% of the value, based upon an appraisal if the loan amount is over $100,000. The Bank also requires title insurance to insure the priority of the property lien on its real estate loans over $50,000 and requires fire and casualty insurance on all of its loans. The real estate loans originated by the Bank contain a due on sale clause, which provides that the Bank may declare the unpaid balance of the loan immediately due and payable upon the sale of the mortgaged property. Such clauses are an important means of reducing the average loan life and increasing the yield on existing fixed rate real estate loans, and it is the Banks policy to enforce due on sale clauses. Real Estate Commercial For the years ended 2006 and 2005, commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $99.2 million or 31.89% and $79.6 million or 30.0% of the Companys loan portfolio, respectively. Commercial real estate mortgage loans include all one to four family residential loans secured by real estate for purposes other than construction or acquisition and development. All real estate loans are held in the Banks loan portfolio except for loans that have been participated to correspondent banks. The Bank will sell these participations if a loan exceeds the Banks legal lending limit or as is deemed appropriate by the Directors Loan Committee. Commercial real estate mortgage loans are a combination of properties that are leased out or used for a primary place of a business the Bank has a relationship with. Most of the commercial real estate loans have fixed interest rates for terms of one to three years with balloon payment provisi ons and are amortized over a 10 to 15 year period, but whenever possible the Bank will seek a variable rate loan which would be tied to the New York prime rate and adjusted monthly. The Banks experience indicates that real estate loans normally remain outstanding for much shorter periods (seven years on average) than their stated maturity because the borrowers repay the loans in full either upon the sale of the secured property or upon the refinancing of the original loan. 25 Commercial real estate loans are made for up to 85% of the value of the property securing the loan, based upon an appraisal if the loan amount is over $100,000. The Bank also requires title insurance to insure the priority of the property lien on its real estate loans over $50,000 and requires fire and casualty insurance on all of its loans. Consumer Loans For the years ended 2006 and 2005, consumer loans totaled $6.1 million or 2.0% and $7.2 million or 2.7% of the Companys loan portfolio, respectively. These loans consist of consumer installment loans and consumer credit card balances. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bank had $504 thousand and $951 thousand credit card balances outstanding, respectively. The Bank makes both secured and unsecured consumer loans for a variety of personal and household purposes. Most of the Banks consumer loans are automobile loans, boat loans, property improvement loans and loans to depositors on the security of their certificates of deposit. These loans are generally made for terms of up to five years at fixed interest rates. The Bank considers consumer loans to involve a relatively high credit risk compared to real estate loans. Consumer loans, therefore, generally yield a relatively high return to the Bank and provide a relatively short maturity. The Bank believes that the generally higher yields and the shorter terms available on various types of consumer loans tend to offset the relatively higher risk associated with such loans, and contribute to a profitable spread between the Banks average yield on earning assets and the Banks cost of funds. Lending Commitments Commitments under standby letters of credit and undisbursed loan commitments increased from $63,972,000 in 2005 to $68,023,000 in 2006. This number includes all lines of credit that have not been fully drawn and loan commitments in the same status. Origination, Purchase and Sale of Loans The Bank originates loans primarily in Hamilton County, Tennessee. The Bank also originates loans in Marion, Sequatchie, Knox and Bradley Counties in Tennessee, and Dade, Walker, Whitfield and Catoosa Counties in Georgia, each of which is within a 50 miles of Chattanooga. Loans are originated by fifteen loan officers who operate from the Banks offices in Chattanooga and one in the Banks Loan Production Office (LPO) in Dalton, Georgia and one in the proposed LPO in Knoxville, Tennessee. These loan officers actively solicit loan applications from existing customers, local manufacturers and retailers, builders, real estate developers, real estate agents and others. The Bank also receives numerous loan applications as a result of customer referrals and walk ins to its offices. Upon receipt of a loan application and all required supporting information from a prospective borrower, the Bank obtains a credit report and verifies specific information relating to the loan applicants employment, income and creditworthiness. For significant extensions of credit in which real estate will secure the proposed loan, a certified appraisal of the real estate is undertaken by an independent appraiser approved by the Bank. The Banks loan officers then analyze the credit worthiness of the borrower and the value of any collateral involved. The Banks loan approval process is intended to be conservative but also responsive to customer needs. Loans are approved in accordance with the Banks written loan policy, which provides for several tiers of approval authority, based on a borrowers aggregate debt with the Bank. Certain loan officers have the authority to approve loans of up to $1,000,000. All other loan officers have the authority to approve secured loans of up to at least $25,000. There is an Officers Loan Committee comprised of the senior officers of the Bank which must approve any loan that increases the borrowers aggregate indebtedness above an individual officers limit, but that is not more than $4,000,000. The Directors Loan Committee must approve all loans over $4,000,000 up to $7,000,000. All loans above $7,000,000 up to the Banks legal lending limit must be approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The Banks legal lending limit is 25% of the Banks qualifying equity for secured loans and 15% for unsecured loans. The Bank has in the past purchased and sold commercial loan participations with correspondent banks and will continue the practice when management feels the action would be in the best interest of shareholders. The purchase of loan participations allows the Bank to expand its loan portfolio and increase profitability while still maintaining the high credit standards, which are applied to all extensions of credit made by the Bank. The sale of loan participations allows the Bank to make larger loans and retain a servicing fee for its labor, which it otherwise would be unable to make due to capital or other funding considerations. The Bank increased its participations purchased 26 from $4.5 million in 2005 to $8.2 million in 2006. The Bank maintained its participations sold at a relatively constant level of $20.8 million in 2005 as compared to $19.4 million in 2006. Loan Fee Income In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives origination fees for making loans, commitment fees for making certain loans, and other fees for miscellaneous loan related services. Such fee income varies with the volume of loans made, prepaid or sold, and the rates of fees vary from time to time depending on the supply of funds and competitive conditions. Commitment fees are charged by the Bank to the borrower for certain loans and are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. These fees normally are deducted from the proceeds of the loan and generally range from 1/2% to 2% of the principal amount, depending on the type and volume of loans made and market conditions such as the demand for loans, the availability of money and general economic conditions. The Bank complies with FASB 91 and amortizes all significant loan fees over the life of the loan. The Bank also receives miscellaneous fee income from late payment charges, overdraft fees, property inspection fees, and miscellaneous services related to its existing loans. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Bank recognized origination, commitment and other loan fees totaling $1.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Problem Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses Problem Loans In originating loans, the Company recognizes that it will experience credit losses and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan. The Company has instituted measures at the Bank which are designed to reduce the risk of, and monitor exposure to, credit losses. The Banks loan portfolio is systematically reviewed by the Banks management, internal auditors, external auditors, and State and Federal regulators to ensure that the Banks larger loan relationships are being maintained within the loan policy guidelines, and remain properly underwritten. Input from all the above sources is used by the Bank to take corrective actions as necessary. As discussed below, each of the Banks loans is assigned a rating in accordance with the Banks internal loan rating system. All past due loans are reviewed by the Banks senior lending officers and all past due loans over $25,000 are reviewed monthly by the Directors Loan Committee. All loans classified as substandard or doubtful, as well as any special mention loans (defined in the following paragraph), are placed on the Banks watch list and reviewed at least monthly by the Directors Loan Committee. In a ddition, all loans to a particular borrower are reviewed, regardless of classification, each time such borrower requests a renewal or extension of any loan or requests an additional loan. All lines of credit are reviewed annually prior to renewal. Such reviews include, but are not limited to, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan, a re assessment of the borrowers financial condition, the value of any collateral and the estimated potential loss to the Bank, if any. The Banks internal problem loan rating system establishes three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Additionally, in connection with regulatory examinations of the Bank, Federal and State examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require the Bank to classify them. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Bank is not warranted. Consequently, such assets are charged off in the month they are classified as loss. Federal regulations also designate a special mention category, described as assets which do not currently expose the Bank to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving managements close attention. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the Bank to establish general allowances for loan losses. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the Bank must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100% of the portion of the asset classified as loss or charge off such amount. General loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified as substandard or doubtful may be included, up to 27 certain limits, in determining the Banks regulatory capital, while specific valuation allowances for loan losses do not qualify as regulatory capital. The Banks collection procedures provide that when a loan becomes 15 days and 30 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted by mail and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact and request payment from the delinquent borrower. Most loan delinquencies are cured within 60 days and no legal action is required. In certain circumstances, the Bank, for a fee, may modify the loan, grant a limited moratorium on loan payments or revise the payment schedule to enable the borrower to restructure his or her financial affairs. Generally, the Bank stops accruing interest and any accrued non collected interest will be reversed in accordance with GAAP on delinquent loans when payment is in arrears for 90 days or when collection otherwise becomes doubtful. If the delinquency exceeds 120 days and is not cured through the Banks normal collection procedures or through a restructuring, the Bank will inst itute measures to enforce its remedies resulting from the default, including commencing a foreclosure, repossession or collection action. In certain cases, the Bank will consider accepting a voluntary conveyance of collateral in lieu of foreclosure or repossession. Real property acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to dispose. Accounting standards define fair value as the amount that is expected to be received in a current sale between a willing buyer and seller other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair values at foreclosure are based on appraisals. Losses arising from the acquisition of foreclosed properties are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent write downs are provided by a charge to income through losses on other real estate in the period in which the need arises. The Bank attempts to sell real estate owned promptly after foreclosure. During 2006 and 2005 the Bank sold $806,346 and $224,696 of its real estate owned due to loan foreclosures, respectively. The book value of real estate owned that was sold by the Bank during 2006 was $773,436 and $244,916 for 2005. As of December 31, 2006, the Bank had $380,000 in value of real estate owned as a result of foreclosure compared to $781,000 in 2005. Table 7 sets forth information regarding the Companys delinquent and non performing assets as of the dates indicated. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance or reserve for possible loan losses is a means of absorbing future losses, which could be incurred from the current loan portfolio. The Bank maintains an allowance for possible loan losses, and management adjusts the general allowances monthly by charges to income in response to changes to outstanding loan balances. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon managements periodic review of the collectibility of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. A loan or portion thereof is charged off against the general allowance when management has determined that losses on such loans are probable. Recoveries on any loans charged off in prior fiscal periods are credited to the allowance. It is the opinion of the Banks management that the balance in the general allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2006 is adequate to absorb possible losses from loans cu rrently in the portfolio. 28 TABLE 7 Delinquent and Non performing Assets Actual for Years Ending December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more: Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 0 $ 216 Real estate construction 0 0 Real estate mortgage 0 0 Consumer 0 0 Total Loans $ 0 $ 216 Non accruing loans 90 days or more: Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 127 $ 0 Real estate construction 186 52 Real estate mortgage 789 670 Consumer 0 12 Total Loans $ 1,102 $ 734 Real estate acquired through foreclosure $ 380 $ 776 Property acquired through repossession 0 5 Total acquired 380 $ 781 Total Loans $ 310,137 $ 265,554 Ratio of non performing assets to total loans 0.48 % 0.66 % Ratio of delinquent (30 days or more) but accruing loans to: Total loans 0.77 % 0.82 % Total assets 0.63 % 0.67 % In addition to the Banks loan rating system for problem assets described above (see Problem Loans, above), the Bank has established a loan rating system for all categories of loans which assists management and the Board of Directors in determining the adequacy of the Banks allowance for loan losses. Each loan in the Banks portfolio is assigned a rating which is reviewed by management periodically to ensure its continued suitability. An exception is made in the case of (i) monthly installment loans which are grouped together by delinquency status such as over 10, 30, 60, or 90 days past due and (ii) problem assets which are rated as substandard, doubtful, or loss as discussed above. All other loans are assigned a rating of excellent, good, or average. The total amount of loans in each of these loan rating categories is weighted by a factor that management believes reasonably reflects losses that can be anticipated with respect to loans in each of these categories. Based on these weightings, the Banks management establishes an allowance for loan losses that is reviewed by its Board of Directors each month.

In doing so, Cornerstone uses the portfolio to provide structure and liquidity that the loan portfolio cannot. The management investment committee balances the market risk and credit risks against the potential investment return, make investments compatible with the pledge requirements of the Companys deposit of public funds, maintain compliance with regulatory investment requirements, and assists the various public entities with their financing needs. The management investment committee is authorized to execute security transactions for the investment portfolio based on the decisions of the Board of Directors Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). All the investment transactions occurring since the previous ALCO meeting are reviewed by the ALCO at its next monthly meeting, in addition to the entire portfolio. The investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short term securities purchased to provide the Banks needed liquidity and longer term securities purchased to generate stable income for the Bank during periods of interest rate fluctuations. The Banks investment portfolio totaled $ 33.9 million or 9.1% of total assets as of year end 2006 compared to a total of $ 31.5 million or 9.7% as of year end 2005. Table 10 sets forth the carrying value of the Banks investments at the dates indicated. Securities are held in both available for sale and held to maturity categories. Securities available for sale are carried at fair market value and securities held to maturity are held at their book value. 31 TABLE 10 Securities Portfolio Years Ending December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Securities available for sale: U.S. Government and agency obligations $ 26,470 $ 22,349 $ 10,977 Mortgage backed and other securities 2,634 4,000 11,326 State and political subdivisions tax exempt 3,249 3,285 3,140 Corporate debt 0 494 1,027 Totals $ 32,353 $ 30,128 $ 26,470 Securities held to maturity: U.S. Government and agency obligations $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Mortgage backed and other securities 236 322 391 State and political subdivisions tax exempt 0 0 0 Corporate debt 0 0 0 Totals $ 236 $ 322 $ 391 Federal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost 1,332 1,034 854 Total Securities $ 33,921 $ 31,484 $ 27,715 For December 31, 2006 tables 11 and 12 set forth the book value of the Banks investments, the weighted average yields on the Banks investments and the periods to maturity of the Banks investments for the Securities Available for Sale and the Securities Held to Maturity, respectively.

(2) Mortgages are allocated by maturity and not amortized Sources of Funds General Time, money market, savings and demand deposits are the major source of the Companys funds for lending and other investment purposes. All deposits are held by the Bank. In addition, the Company obtains funds from loan principal repayments and proceeds from sales of loan participations and investment securities. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and sales of loan participations and investment securities are significantly influenced by prevailing interest rates, economic conditions and the Companys asset and liability management strategies. Borrowings are used on either a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds or on a longer term basis to reduce interest rate risk. Deposits The Bank offers several types of deposit accounts, with the principal differences relating to the minimum balances required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Deposits are obtained primarily from the Banks Chattanooga Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The Bank does advertise for deposits outside of this area and has had moderate success attracting deposits from credit unions around the United States. The Bank does not solicit funds from brokers. The Bank does not rely upon any single person or group of related persons for a material portion of its deposits. However, the Bank has a large depositor related to its ACH business line that leaves a large amount of money for the Bank to use as it passes through the Bank to its final destination. A principal source of deposits for the Bank consists of short term money market and other accounts, which are highly responsive to changes in market interest rat es. Accordingly, the Bank, like all financial institutions, is subject to short term fluctuations in deposits in response to customer actions due to changing short term market interest rates. The ability of the Bank to attract and maintain deposits and the Banks cost of funds has been and will continue to be significantly affected by money market conditions. Table 15 sets forth the composition of deposits for the Company, excluding accrued interest payable, by type for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. 34 TABLE 15 Deposit Composition Years Ending December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Demand deposits $ 41,723 $ 42,118 $ 34,024 NOW deposits 38,160 33,080 32,855 Savings & money market deposits 56,913 55,411 31,211 Time deposits under $100,000 94,476 83,119 59,653 Time deposits $100,000 and over 44,544 38,707 30,089 Total Deposits $ 275,816 $ 252,435 $ 187,832 Table 16 presents a breakdown by category of the average amount of deposits and the average rate paid on deposits for the periods indicated: TABLE 16 Average Amount and Average Rate Paid on Deposits Years Ending December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate (in thousands) Demand deposits $ 37,056 $ 34,730 $ 27,918 NOW deposits 34,701 1.23 % 33,943 0.97 % 28,843 0.48 % Savings & money market deposits 58,477 3.80 % 45,232 2.45 % 32,282 1.33 % Time deposits under $100,000 88,773 4.39 % 70,167 3.19 % 58,367 2.50 % Time deposits $100,000 and over 43,692 4.56 % 32,611 3.51 % 25,734 2.52 % Total Deposits $ 262,699 3.78 % $ 216,683 2.65 % $ 173,144 1.55 % Borrowings The Bank joined the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati in October of 2000. The Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB) allows the Bank to borrow funds on a contractual basis many times at rates lower than the costs of local certificates of deposit. In addition, the FHLB has the ability to provide structured advances that best reduce or leverage the interest rate risk of the Bank. The Bank as of the end of the year had $39 million outstanding with the FHLB. The $39 million is comprised of two types of borrowing structures. The first advance structure involves a daily revolving credit advance totaling $15 million. The remaining $24 million is comprised of loans that range in amounts from $2 to $5 million in size and are structured as ten year obligations with an optional conversion to a floating rate after a stated period of time. The loans have maturities ranging from December 2010 to January 2016 and have conversion dates ranging from immediate to January 2011. Interest rates range from 2.4% to 5.0%. The Bank has several Federal Funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks with a total availability of $37 million as of the end of 2006. In addition, the Bank has the right to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank if necessary to supplement its supply of funds available for lending and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had established a line of credit of $8.5 million priced at New York Prime Rate minus 150 basis points. The loan was established to insert capital infusions to the Bank to fund growth or retire treasury stock, if any, as needed. This line allows the Company to act as a source of strength for the Bank without the expense or dilution of additional common stock. As of December 31, 2006, there was $500,000 borrowed on the line of credit and the Company has the remainder amount available to inject capital into the Bank or fund other investments. Balance Sheet Management Liquidity Management. Liquidity is the ability of a company to convert assets into cash without significant loss and to raise funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves having the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs. 35 The primary function of asset / liability management is not only to assure adequate liquidity in order for the Company to meet the needs of its customer base, but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the Company can profitably deploy its assets and therefore optimize earnings. Both assets and liabilities are considered sources of liquidity funding and both are, therefore, monitored on a daily basis. The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan repayment and maturity of investment securities. Additional sources of liquidity are the investment in Federal Funds sold and prepayments from the mortgage backed securities from the investment portfolio. The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts. Other short term liabilities, which do not qualify as a deposit, are Federal Funds purchased and securities under agreement to repurchase (REPOs). Both are temporary solutions for liquidity as Federal Funds must be paid off at least once every 30 days and REPOs must be collateralized by investment securities. At year end 2005 the Company had $2.4 million Federal Funds purchased and $2.4 million in REPOs. By year end 2006 the amount in Federal Funds purchased had increased to $14.6 million and $4.6 million in REPOs. The increase in Fed Funds purchased varies daily but began to trend higher as the volume of payment processing increased. The increase in payments was actively sought as a source of non interest income and the Bank expects the trend to continue upward as the Bank continues to expand its payment processing line of business. Longer term liabilities are limited to FHLB advances, which would be used to reduce interest rate risk, and Company loans used to repurchase common stock or finance any acquisition in the future. Capital Resources / Liquidity Liquidity. Of primary importance to depositors, creditors and regulators is the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities. The Companys liquidity, represented by cash and cash from banks, is a result of its operating, investing and financing activities. In order to ensure funds are available at all times, the Company devotes resources to projecting on a monthly basis the amount of funds accessible. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short term borrowing or the disposition of short term assets, which are generally matched to correspond to the maturity of liabilities. The Companys liquidity target is measured by adding the Banks net cash, short term and marketable securities not pledged and dividing this number by total deposits and short term liabilities not secured by assets pledged. The approved liquidity policy is targeted at 10%. The Banks liquidity ratio at year end 2006 was 8.4% compared to 7.9% at year end 2005. The Company is not subject to any specific liquidity requirements imposed by regulatory orders. The Company is subject to general FDIC guidelines, which do not require a minimum level of liquidity. Management believes its liquidity ratios meet or exceed these guidelines. Management does not know of any trends or demands, which are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material manner. Table 17 sets forth the average loan to deposit ratios, a liquidity measure, for periods indicated: TABLE 17 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Average loans to average deposits 108.15 % 109.04 % Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices. The financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of the financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. Management is primarily concerned with two inflationary factors. The first and the most common is the general impact of inflation on operations of the Company and is reflected in increased operating costs. The other and more material to the Banks profitability are interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve and the general fixed income market in reaction to inflation. In other words, interest rate risk, unlike most industrial companies, substantially impacts the Company because virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates may have a more significant impact on the Companys performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. 36 Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services and each issue must be dealt with independently. Capital Adequacy Capital adequacy refers to the level of capital required to sustain asset growth and to absorb losses. The objective of the Companys management is to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while meeting regulatory requirements. This is achieved by improving profitability by effectively allocating resources to more profitable business, improving asset quality, strengthening service quality, and streamlining costs. The primary measures used by management to monitor the results of these efforts are the ratios of actual equity to average assets and actual equity to risk adjusted assets. The FDIC has adopted capital guidelines governing the activities of banks. These guidelines require the maintenance of an amount of capital based on risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk will require more capital backing than assets with lower risk. In addition, banks are required to maintain capital to support, on a risk adjusted basis, certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments. The capital guidelines classify capital into two tiers, referred to as Tier I and Tier II. Under risk based capital requirements, total capital consists of Tier I capital which is generally common shareholders equity less goodwill and Tier II which is primarily Tier I capital plus a portion of the loan loss allowance. In determining risk based capital requirements, assets are assigned risk weights of 0% to 100%, depending primarily on the regulatory assigned levels of credit risk associated with such assets. Off balance sheet items are considered in the calculation of risk adjusted assets through conversion factors established by regulators. The framework for calculating risk based capital requires banks to meet the regulatory minimums of 4% Tier I and 8% total risk based capital. In 1990 regulators added a leverage computation to the capital requirements, comparing Tier I capital to total average assets less goodwill. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) established five capital categories for banks. Under the regulation defining these five capital categories, each bank is classified into one of the five categories based on its level of risk based capital as measured by Tier I capital, total risk based capital, and Tier I leverage ratios and its supervisory ratings. Table 18 lists the five categories of capital and each of the minimum requirements for the three risk based ratios. TABLE 18 Minimum Requirements for Risk Based Capital Ratios Total Risk Based Capital Ratio Tier I Risk Based Capital Ratio Leverage Ratio Well capitalized 10% or above 6% or above 5% or above Adequately capitalized 8% or above 4% or above 4% or above Under Capitalized Less than 8% Less than 4% Less than 4% Significantly undercapitalized Less than 6% Less than 3% Less than 3% Critically undercapitalized 2% or less As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company exceeded the regulatory minimums and qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulations. The Bank adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard number 123R in 2006. There are no critical accounting policies applied that have alternative applications which would likely change the results of operations in a material amount. Management of the Bank believes it has made the proper judgments about its selection of accounting policies. The Companys Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) actively measures and manages interest rate risk using a process developed by the Bank. The ALCO is also responsible for approving the Companys asset/liability management policies, overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing the Companys interest rate sensitivity position. The primary tool that management uses to measure short term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent national consulting firm and reviewed by another separate and independent national consulting firm. These simulations estimate the impact that various changes in the overall level 37 of interest rates over one and two year time horizons would have on net interest income. The results help the Company develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. Like any forecasting technique, interest rate simulation modeling is based on a large number of assumptions. In this case, the assumptions relate primarily to loan and deposit growth, asset and liability prepayments, interest rates and balance sheet management strategies. Management believes that both individually and in the aggregate the assumptions are reasonable. Nevertheless, the simulation modeling process produces only a sophisticated estimate, not a precise calculation of exposure. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Table 19 sets forth the re pricing of the Companys interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2006. This interest sensitivity gap table is designed to monitor the Companys interest rate risk exposure within the designated time period. In order to control interest rate risk, management regularly monitors the volume of interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals. The Companys interest rate management policy is to attempt to maintain a relatively stable net interest margin in periods of interest rate fluctuations. The Companys policy is to attempt to maintain a ratio of cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets of negative 15.00% to positive 15.00% in the time period of one year or less. At year end, the Bank was in a positive one year cumulative GAP position of 0.99% and is confident that it is positioned properly for the Federa l Reserves FOMC anticipated actions during 2007. The Bank to date has not participated in any derivative products to address this issue and does not foresee the need to do so in the immediate future. The information set forth below is based on the following assumptions of management: (i) savings and money market and NOW accounts will be less interest rate sensitive and the re pricing on these accounts will be spread out over a five year period; and (ii) securities other than mortgage backed securities have been scheduled by maturity date while mortgages have been amortized over the life of the mortgage.
