ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 The following financial review presents managements discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations during the period of 2004 through 2006. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical Accounting Policies As described under Supervision and Regulation, the financial services industry is highly regulated. Furthermore, the nature of the financial services industry is such that, other than described below, the use of estimates and management judgment are not likely to present a material risk to the financial statements. In cases where estimates or management judgment are required, internal controls and processes are established to provide assurance that such estimates and management judgments are materially correct to the best of managements knowledge. Allowance for loan losses Accounting for loan classifications, accrual status, and determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on regulatory guidance. This guidance includes, but is not limited to, generally accepted accounting principles, the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and the joint policy statement on the allowance for loan losses methodologies issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and various other regulatory agencies. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses includes a reserve calculation based on an evaluation of loans determined to be impaired, risk ratings, historical losses, loans past due, general and local economic conditions, trends, portfolio concentrations, collateral values and other subjective factors. Commercial loan rating system and identification of impaired loans The Company has a defined risk rating system that is designed to assess the risk of individual loans and overall risk of the commercial loan portfolio. The system assigns a risk weighting to factors such as cash flow, collateral, financial condition, operating performance, repayment history, management, and strength of the industry. An assessment of risk is performed as a part of the loan approval process as well as periodic updates based on the circumstances of the individual loan. Also, in addition to routine examinations by bank regulators, the Company employs external loan review services to assess the accuracy of risk ratings. 15 Originated mortgage servicing rights (OMSR) The Company records the original OMSR based on market data. The OMSR is amortized into non interest income, in proportion to the period of the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial asset. Additionally, an independent third party valuation is performed to determine potential impairment of the OMSR as a result of changes in interest rates and expected future loan repayment speeds. Changes in interest rates or repayment speeds could have an impact on the carrying value of the mortgage servicing assets. FINANCIAL CONDITION Summary Total assets increased $78 million, or 13 percent during 2006 to $669 million. For the year, total loans outstanding increased $61 million, or 13 percent and total deposits increased $79 million, or 16 percent. The increase in total loans was primarily due to a $64 million, or 18 percent increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which was somewhat offset by a $3 million, or 13 percent decline in consumer loans. The increase in total deposits was largely due to a $66 million, or 31 percent increase in time deposits. A discussion of changes in balance sheet amounts by major categories follows: Securities (in thousands) The Bank maintains a diversified securities portfolio, which includes obligations of government sponsored agencies, securities issued by states and political subdivisions, corporate securities, mortgage backed securities, and money market preferred stocks. The primary objective of the Companys investing activities is to provide a source of liquidity, provide for safety of the principal invested and manage the Banks exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank pledges some of its securities to secure Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The Bank was required to have approximately $4 million pledged at each of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. All of the Companys securities are classified as available for sale. As a result, changes in market value are recognized as adjustments to the carrying amount on the balance sheet and gains or losses are reported, net of tax, as an adjustment to the Banks stockholders equity. The Companys total holdings increased approximately $14 million from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The increase is the result of the asset liability management of the Bank in relation to the loan and deposit growth the Bank experienced in 2006.

The Board of Directors of the Bank approves the loan authority for each lender and has appointed a Chief Lending Officer who is responsible for the supervision of the lending activities of the Bank. The Bank uses the services of an independent third party, to periodically review the credit quality of the loan portfolio, separate from the loan approval process. These reviews are submitted to the Risk Management Officer and to the Audit Committee. Requests to the Bank for credit are considered on the basis of the creditworthiness of each applicant, without consideration of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, physical handicap, age, or the receipt of income from public assistance programs. Consideration is given to the applicants capacity for repayment based on cash flow, collateral, capital and alternative sources of repayment. Loan applications are accepted at all the Banks offices and are approved within the limits of each lending officers authority. Loan requests in excess of specific lending officers authority, are required to be presented to the Commercial Loan Committee, the Directors Loan Committee or the Board of Directors for review and approval. The Bank does not have any foreign loans and there were no large concentrations of loans that are not disclosed as a separate category. The Banks largest concentration of loans is to businesses in the form of commercial loans and real estate mortgages. Management reviews the concentration, and changes in concentrations of loans, using the method of coding the commercial loan portfolio by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. During 2006, the Bank continued to experience excellent growth in its commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios. Commercial real estate loans increased $44 million, or 17 percent and commercial loans increased $20 million, or 23 percent. The commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are the primary source of growth for the Banks total loan portfolios and are expected to continue to be in the future. Consumer loans declined $3 million, or 13 percent from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The decline in total consumer loans is the result of the continued run off of the Banks consumer indirect lending business. As of December 31, 2006, the Bank had indirect loans totaling approximately $5 million, down 27 percent from $7 million at December 31, 2005. Management expects the indirect consumer loan portfolio to continue to decline during 2007. Total loans secured by residential real estate, at December 31, 2006, was $87 million, which was no change from December 31, 2005. 17 It is the Banks general practice to sell residential real estate loans with maturities over 15 years. During 2006, the Bank sold loans totaling approximately $2 million with the servicing rights retained and $38 million with the servicing rights released. As a result of fewer loans being sold with servicing rights released, the Banks servicing portfolio has declined. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bank was servicing loans totaling approximately $180 million and $205 million, respectively. In addition to the communities served by the Banks branches, principal lending markets include nearby communities and metropolitan areas. Subject to established underwriting criteria, the Bank will occasionally participate with other financial institutions to reduce the Banks exposure to risk on certain large commercial loans or to fund loans, which would otherwise exceed the Banks legal lending limit if made solely by the Bank.

The loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower and are underwritten based on an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates, management, economic conditions, cash flow, owners equity and collateral. Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the Banks primary market area. Residential Real Estate Loans: Residential real estate loans are originated in the Banks primary market area. Generally, the Bank sells all salable loans in the secondary market. Loans are underwritten to the Secondary Market Investors Guidelines using the automated underwriting system designed by the investor that will be purchasing a particular loan. On occasion, residential real estate loans will be retained in the Banks portfolio. Personal loans secured by the equity in the borrowers residence are also granted for a variety of needs. Consumer Loans: Consumer loans are originated for a variety of purposes including the acquisition of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrowers credit history, monthly income, stability of employment, the amount of the down payment and the type of collateral. Management takes steps in the loan administration area to ensure that the Banks underwriting standards are adequate. Management believes that the asset quality of the Bank continues to be in excellent shape. However, asset quality is also dependent upon general and local economic conditions and other factors outside of the Banks control. 18 Non performing Assets (in thousands) Non performing assets are comprised of loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued, accruing loans 90 days or more past due in payments and collateral for loans and other real estate, which has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition. Loans, including loans considered impaired under SFAS No. 118 and SFAS No. 114, are generally placed on a non accrual basis when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and interest is unlikely. December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Non accrual loans $ 954 $ 1,178 $ 1,430 $ 466 $ 8,290 90 days or more past due & still accruing 374 65 94 1,018 Total non performing loans 954 1,552 1,495 560 9,308 Other real estate 186 248 1,539 Total non performing assets $ 1,140 $ 1,800 $ 1,495 $ 2,099 $ 9,308 As a percentage of portfolio loans Non performing loans .19 % .34 % .37 % .15 % 2.47 % Non performing assets .22 % .40 % .37 % .58 % 2.47 % Allowance for loan losses 1.46 % 1.58 % 1.67 % 2.31 % 2.22 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans 787 % 461 % 458 % 1,498 % 90 % The Banks total non performing assets as of December 31, 2006 declined 37 percent, compared to December 31, 2005. This decline primarily reflects the reduction in the number of loans that were 90 day or more past due and still accruing and the sale of two small commercial properties that were held as other real estate at the end of 2005. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of portfolio loans declined from 1.58 percent at December 31, 2005 to 1.46 percent at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006 there were no other interest bearing assets, which required classification. Foregone Interest on Non Performing Loans (in thousands) The table below presents the interest income that would have been earned on non performing loans outstanding at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 had those loans been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements (pro forma interest) and the amount of interest income actually included in net interest income for those years.

Due to the growth of the Banks loan portfolio and continued improvements in the Banks asset quality, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased from 1.58 percent at December 31, 2004 to 1.46 percent at December 31, 2005. Net loans charged off for the year, as a percentage of average loans outstanding was .04 percent for both 2006 and 2005, compared to .12 percent in 2004. The decline from 2004 is primarily the result of the reduction in the amount of consumer loans charged off during the year, which was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of funds recovered on loans. 20 Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses (dollars in thousands) The allowance for loan losses is analyzed quarterly by management. In so doing, management assigns a portion of the allowance to specific credits that have been identified as problem loans, reviews past loss experience, the local economy and a number of other factors. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate.

The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans reflects managements assessment of the improved quality of the Banks assets and the decline in non performing assets. The first element reflects our estimate of probable losses based upon our systematic review of specific loans. These estimates are based upon a number of objective factors, such as payment history, financial condition of the borrower, and discounted collateral exposure. The second element reflects the application of our loan rating system. This rating system is similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulators. Loans that are rated below a certain predetermined classification are assigned a loss allocation factor. The third element is determined by assigning allocations based principally upon the five year average of loss experience for each type of loan. Additionally, an allocation is provided based on the current delinquency rate for some loan categories. Loss analyses are conducted at least annually. The fourth element is based on factors that cannot be associated with a specific credit or loan category and reflects our attempt to ensure that the overall allowance for loan losses appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in the estimates of expected credit losses. We also consider a number of subjective factors when determining the allowance for loan losses, including local and general economic business factors and trends, portfolio concentrations and changes in the size, mix and general terms of the loan portfolios. 21 While considerable attention has been devoted to the national housing market, the national economy continues to move forward, albeit at a slower pace. Economic conditions in Michigan are weaker than the national economy. The Michigan economy continues to struggle with the loss of jobs associated with the transportation equipment manufacturing. Michigan is one of two states that reported a decline in jobs during 2006. Additionally, the sale of existing homes declined nearly twice the rate of the decline in the national rate. The economy in West Michigan, while stronger than the state as a whole, is influenced by the States economy. Although highly subjective, the economic conditions in Michigan, is reflected in the amount reserved in the allowance for possible loan losses. Actual losses experienced in the future could vary from the estimated allocation of the loan loss reserve. Changes in local and national economic factors could affect the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Sources of Funds The primary sources of funding for the Bank are deposits (including brokered deposits), Federal Home Loan Bank advances, federal funds purchased and other borrowed funds. Total deposits increased $79 million, or 16 percent, from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The largest increases occurred in interest bearing checking accounts and time deposits, which increased $18 million, or 15 percent, and $66 million, or 31 percent, respectively, from 2005 to 2006. These increases were partially offset by a decline in money market and savings accounts of $10 million, or 11 percent from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The increases in interest bearing checking accounts and time deposits are the results of a successful deposit account acquisition campaign and targeted marketing for the Banks time deposit products. The increase in time deposits include a decline in brokered deposits of $17 million, or 22 percent. Brokered deposits are used by the Bank to fund loan growth, when it exceeds the Banks ability to grow local deposits. The Bank plans to continue to use brokered deposits as part of its asset & liability management plan. Non deposit sources of funding declined $6 million, or 16 percent from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. Federal funds purchased and FHLB advances each declined $3 million from 2005 to 2006. Deposits are gathered from the communities the Bank serves. Increasing core deposits is a key element of the Banks strategic plan. The checking and savings product mix is also aligned to reward customers with special values if they maintain at least two accounts with the Bank. This is designed to improve the level of core deposits. In addition to the traditional bank offices, the Company provides a wide array of alternative electronic methods to serve customers. Use of the Banks cash management products as well as business sweep products has increased during the past year. The Bank expects these products to continue to be excellent tools in marketing to potential business customers. Mobile Banking, a business banking courier service in West Michigan that provides convenient, safe, and reliable pick up and delivery for a variety of items including cash, checks and important Bank documents, has also been beneficial in increasing the Banks customer base. This service continues to be a key factor in attracting new business customers to the Bank.

Management monitors rates at other financial institutions in the area to ascertain that its rates are competitive with the market. Management also attempts to offer a wide variety of products to meet the needs of its customers. The Bank offers business and consumer checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with many term options. Increases in short term market interest rates as well as competitive pressures contributed to a significant increase in the average rates paid on deposits.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary The Company achieved net income of $7.0 million in 2006, up 16 percent from the $6.1 million reported for 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the full year amounted to $2.86, an increase of 16 percent over the $2.46 reported in 2005. The rise in net income was the result of increases in net interest income and non interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non interest expenses. Net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 9 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. This was due to the increase in average earning assets that occurred during the year, which was partially offset by decline in the net interest margin from 2005 to 2006. The net interest margin was 3.92 percent in 2006 compared to 4.04 percent in 2005. Non interest income increased $1.0 million, or 19 percent from 2005 to 2006. The primary reason for this was an increase in service charge income, due to an increase in the charge for overdrafts, improved collection of overdraft fees and the introduction of an overdraft privilege product in August of 2006. This was partially offset by decreases in revenue from mortgage banking and insurance premiums. Total non interest expenses increased $1.4 million, or 8 percent from 2005 to 2006. This was largely due to increases in salaries, employee benefits and occupancy expenses related to the addition of the new Wayland branch, which opened in the fourth quarter of 2005. 23 Net interest income increased $4.9 million, or 30 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was largely due to the improvement in the net interest margin, due to increases in short term interest rates. The net interest margin increased from 3.42 percent in 2004 to 4.04 percent in 2005. During 2005, the Bank charged a provision for loan losses to income of $480,000, compared to a credit of $1.1 million in 2004. The significant change was the result of improvements in the Banks asset quality that occurred in 2004, allowing the Bank to reverse $1.1 million from the allowance for loan losses in the forth quarter of 2004. The provision that was charged to income in 2005 was the result of the increases in the Banks loan portfolio. Non interest income declined 7 percent in 2005, compared to 2004, which was the result of a 14 percent decline in mortgage banking revenue and a $4,000 net loss on the sale of available for sale securities in 2005, compared to $282,000 net gain on sales of available for sale securities in 2004. Total non interest expenses increased 4 percent from 2004 to 2005. Salaries and benefits expenses remained flat in 2005, compared to 2004. This was mainly the result of increases in salaries being offset by a reduction in the cost of providing employee health care. Non employment related expenses increased 10 percent in 2005. This was the result of increases in marketing, printing and supplies and professional fees related to the name change of the Bank that occurred in 2005 as well as increases in data processing and software expenses. Earnings Performance (in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 7,022 $ 6,058 $ 4,504 Per share of common stock $ 2.86 $ 2.46 $ 1.83 Earnings ratios: Return on average assets 1.11 % 1.07 % .87 % Return on average equity 11.15 % 10.28 % 8.05 % Net income increased 16 percent from 2005 to 2006. This was primarily the result of the increase in net interest income and service charge income, which was partially offset by declines in revenue from mortgage banking and insurance premiums, as well as, an increase in non interest expenses. This resulted in an increase in earnings per share from $2.46 in 2005 to $2.86 in 2006. Net income increased 35 percent from 2004 to 2005. This was primarily the result of the improvement in the Banks net interest margin that occurred in 2005, which was partially offset by a decline in non interest income of 7 percent, due to a decline in net gains on the sale of securities and a decline in mortgage banking revenues. This resulted in an increase in earnings per share from $1.83 in 2004 to $2.46 in 2005. 24 Net Interest Income The following schedule presents the average daily balances, interest income (on a fully taxable equivalent basis) and interest expense and average rates earned and paid for the Companys major categories of assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity for the periods indicated: Interest Yields and Costs (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 AverageBalance Interest Yield/Cost AverageBalance Interest Yield/Cost AverageBalance Interest Yield/Cost Assets Federal funds sold $ 4,793 $ 243 5.08 % $ 638 $ 22 3.48 % $ 3,283 $ 37 1.14 % Securities: Taxable 72,290 3,196 4.45 % 68,451 2,587 3.78 % 75,185 2,296 3.05 % Tax exempt(1) 40,909 2,183 5.28 % 33,914 1,890 5.57 % 27,261 1,608 5.93 % Loans and leases(2)(3) 483,994 36,032 7.44 % 434,387 28,114 6.47 % 383,072 21,286 5.56 % Total earning assets/total interest income 601,986 $ 41,654 6.92 % 537,390 $ 32,613 6.07 % 488,801 25,227 5.16 % Cash and due from banks 11,915 11,002 10,667 All other assets 19,343 18,745 18,291 Total assets $ 633,244 $ 567,137 $517,759 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing deposits: MMDA, Savings/NOW accounts $ 210,385 $ 4,878 2.32 % $ 207,501 $ 2,529 1.22 % $ 167,980 $ 1,399 0.83 % Time 251,690 11,370 4.52 % 185,169 6,414 3.46 % 154,725 5,054 3.27 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased 5,741 288 5.02 % 17,242 400 2.32 % 49,310 412 0.83 % Other borrowed money 27,707 1,538 5.55 % 29,273 1,541 5.27 % 31,162 1,633 5.24 % Total interest bearing liabilities/ total interest expense 495,523 $ 18,074 3.65 % 439,185 $ 10,884 2.48 % 403,177 $ 8,498 2.11 % Non interest bearing deposits 69,244 65,327 57,651 All other liabilities 5,501 3,681 990 Total liabilities 570,268 508,193 461,818 Total stockholders equity 62,976 58,944 55,941 Total liabilities and equity $ 633,244 $ 567,137 $517,759 Net interest income FTE $ 23,580 $ 21,729 $16,729 Net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets FTE 3.92 % 4.04 % 3.42 % (1) Interest income on tax exempt securities and loans is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 34 percent. (2) Non accrual loans and leases and loans held for sale have been included in the average loans and lease balances. Average non accrual loans were approximately $1,049,000, $1,678,000 and $1,450,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. (3) Interest on loans includes net origination fees totaling $203,000 in 2006, $245,000 in 2005, and $258,000 in 2004. 25 Net interest income is the principal source of income for the Company. In the current year, tax equivalent net interest income increased $1.9 million to $23.6 million in 2006, a 9 percent increase from 2005. This resulted in a net interest margin, as a percentage of average earning assets, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, of 3.92 percent. In 2006, the yield on total earning assets increased 85 basis points, compared to a 117 basis point increase in the total interest bearing liabilities cost of funds. The increase in both the interest yield and the cost of funds was a direct result of the short term rates rising during the first half of 2006 and the competitive market for deposits. This resulted in the Companys net interest margin declining 12 basis points, from 4.04 percent in 2005 to 3.92 percent in 2006. In 2005, the yield on total earning assets increased 91 basis points, compared to a 37 basis point increase in the total interest bearing liabilities cost of funds. The increase in both the interest yield and the cost of funds was a direct result of the short term rates rising during 2005. As a result, the Companys net interest margin improved from 3.42 percent in 2004 to 4.04 percent in 2005. Management expects that there will be continued pressure on the Companys net interest margin during 2006, due to increases in the cost of funds and lower spreads on loans related to increased competition for both loans and deposits. The net interest margin is also considerably affected by the monetary policies of the U.S. government, local competition and level of economic activity. There is no assurance regarding rates and the Banks net interest margin.

(2) Interest income on tax exempt securities and loans is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 34 percent. 26 Interest from loans is the primary source of interest income for the Bank. Net interest income is significantly influenced by results of the Banks lending activities. During 2006, interest income increased $9.0 million, while interest expense increased $7.2 million over the same period, resulting in a $1.9 million increase in net interest income, when compared to 2005. The primary reasons that interest income increased faster than interest expense was due to average earning assets increasing more than average interest paying liabilities as well as the interest rates that are earned on loans and investments being higher than the rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds.. During 2005, interest income increased $7.4 million, while interest expense increased only $2.4 million over the same period, resulting in a $5.0 million increase in net interest income, when compared to 2004. The primary reason interest income increased faster than interest expense was the increase in short term interest rates raising the interest rates on variable rate loans faster than the increase in rates of variable rate deposits. The Banks asset/liability committee seeks to manage sources and uses of funds and to monitor the gap in maturities of these funds to maintain a steady net interest margin in varying market conditions. Composition of Average Earning Assets and Interest Paying Liabilities Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As a percent of average earning assets Loans 80 % 81 % 78 % Other earning assets 20 % 19 % 22 % Average earning assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Savings and NOW accounts 35 % 39 % 34 % Time deposits 42 % 34 % 32 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, fed funds purchased and other borrowings 6 % 9 % 16 % Average interest bearing liabilities 83 % 82 % 82 % Average earning asset to total assets 95 % 95 % 94 % Free funds ratio 17 % 18 % 18 % The Banks earning asset ratio remained at 95 percent for both 2006 and 2005. The Banks earning asset ratio increased to 95 percent in 2005, compared to 94 percent in 2004, due mainly to the increase in the Banks loan portfolio. The free funds ratio, funds on which the Bank does not pay interest, declined to 17 percent in 2006, compared to 18 percent in both 2005 and 2004. The decline is mainly the result of the increase in interest bearing deposits. Provision and Allowance for Loan Loss The provision for loan losses charged to earnings was $540,000 in 2006. This compares to a charge of $480,000 in 2005 and a credit to income of $1,100,000 in 2004. The provision that was charged to earnings in 2006 and 2005 was due to the increases in the Banks loan portfolios. The credit to income in 2004 was the result of the improvement in the asset quality of the Bank. Management is projecting that the provision for loan losses charged to income in 2007 will increase, compared to 2006, to support the Banks anticipated loan growth, net charge offs and changes in credit quality. The actual provision charged to income may vary from the projected amount based on changes in these factors. Management monitors the underwriting standards and loan administration of the Bank, to ensure that they are appropriate. Future changes in asset quality will be subject to continued adherence to established policies and the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Bank operates. 27 Non interest Income (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Service charges on deposit accounts $ 3,922 $ 2,540 $ 2,432 Net gains on asset sales: Loans 679 905 1,090 Securities 18 (4 ) 282 Amortization of mortgage servicing rights (419 ) (434 ) (621 ) Recovery of impairment on mortgage servicing rights 86 Loan servicing fees 510 581 673 Insurance premium revenue 874 1,067 1,112 Brokerage revenue 233 256 278 Other 708 568 535 Total non interest income $ 6,525 $ 5,479 $ 5,867 Non interest income increased $1,046,000, or 19 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to a $1,382,000, or 54 percent increase in service charges on deposit accounts. The significant increase was due to an increase in the charge for overdrafts, growth of deposit account, improved collection of overdraft fees and the introduction of a new overdraft privilege product. Other non interest income increased $140,000, or 25 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. This increase includes the recognition of a gain of $173,000 on other Bank real estate, during the second quarter of 2006. Offsetting these increases was a $226,000, or 25 percent decline in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans. This decline is directly related to Michigans slow housing market. Insurance premium revenue declined $193,000, or 18 percent from 2005 to 2006. This was due to a decline in the annual profit sharing income, received from the insurance underwriters, which is based on the loss rate of the insurance agency policyholders, as well as the current insurance policyholders renewing at lower premiums. Non interest income declined $388,000, or 7 percent in 2005, compared to 2004. This decline was mainly the result of a decline in mortgage related fees and change in the net gains or losses on the sale of securities. Mortgage related fees declined $176,000, or 14 percent from 2004 to 2005. This was mainly the result of a slow down in mortgage activity, due primarily to increases in mortgage interest rates. The decline in the net gains on the sale of securities is due to a $4,000 loss that was recognized in 2005 compared to a $282,000 gain in 2004. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $108,000, or 4 percent, in 2005, compared to 2004. This increase reflects the increases in income from NSF fees and ATM fees due to higher volume. 28 Net Gains on the Sale of Real Estate Mortgage Loans (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Total real estate mortgage loan originations $ 51,677 $ 75,094 $ 85,605 Real estate mortgage loan sales, servicing retained $ 1,867 $ 1,860 $ 42,574 Real estate mortgage loan sales, servicing released $ 37,855 $ 56,739 $ 24,892 Net gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans $ 679 $ 905 $ 1,090 Net gains as a percent of real estate mortgage loan sales 1.71 % 1.54 % 1.62 % The gain on the sale of real estate loans declined 25 percent from 2005 to 2006 as mortgage activity dropped for the third straight year. The slow down has been the result of increases in mortgage rates and a slow housing market. Total real estate mortgages originated declined to $52 million in 2006, compared to $75 million in 2005 and $86 million in 2004. During 2005 and 2006, the Bank sold a majority of loans with servicing rights released. Interest rates on loans with servicing rights released were favorable for customers, when compared to the interest rates of loans with servicing rights retained. Selling loans with servicing rights released also reduces the Banks exposure to changes in the value of the servicing rights, due to changes in interest rates. Net gains as a percentage of real estate mortgage loan sales for 2006 increased to 1.71%, compared to 1.54 percent in 2005 and 1.62 percent in 2004. Net gains on the sale of loans are generally a function of the volume of loans sold. The volume of loans sold is dependent upon the Banks ability to originate loans, which is particularly sensitive to the absolute level of interest rates. Net gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans are also dependent upon economic and competitive factors as well as managements ability to effectively manage the Banks exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank aggressively markets its services in the real estate area. Realized Gains and Losses on the Sale of Securities (in thousands) Year ended December 31, Proceeds Gains Losses Net 2006 $ 8,063 $ 73 $ 55 $ 18 2005 $ 8,823 $ 57 $ 61 $(4 ) 2004 $12,802 $282 $ $282 The Company recognized a net gain of $18,000 on the sale of securities in 2006, compared to a net loss of $4,000 in 2005 and a net gain of $282,000 in 2004. Approximately $200,000 of the gain in 2004 was due to the sale of equity securities, of predominately other bank stocks, which were held at the parent company. In addition to providing interest income and secondary liquidity, our securities portfolio is an important part of our asset and liquidity management plan. Generally, the majority of the securities in the investment portfolio are classified as available for sale to provide flexibility in managing the Banks liquidity and interest rate risk. 29 Non interest Expense (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Salaries $ 9,590 $ 8,524 $ 8,184 Employee benefits 1,718 1,687 2,015 Occupancy 1,509 1,399 1,305 Equipment 970 963 1,130 Data processing and software 1,548 1,398 1,215 Professional and legal fees 521 590 564 Printing and supplies 326 431 356 Marketing 415 429 237 Other 2,452 2,210 1,940 Total non interest expense $ 19,049 $ 17,631 $ 16,946 Non interest expense increased $1,418,000, or 8 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $1,097,000 or 11 percent from 2005 to 2006. The increase was the result of the additional staffing, including staff increases associated with the opening of the new Wayland branch, the addition of new loan officers and the expansion of our Mobile Banking service. Occupancy costs increased $110,000, or 8 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. This was also due to the additional expenses related to the new Wayland branch. Data processing and software expenses increased $150,000 or 11 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. This was the result of the Banks significant investment in new information technology equipment and software. Printing and supplies expenses declined $105,000 or 24 percent in 2006, compared to 2005. This was primarily due to additional expenses related to the name change of the Bank that occurred in 2005. Other items that contributed to the increase in non interest expense was a $74,000 impairment charge that was taken on the Banks former retail loan center, which is currently listed for sale, as well as additional losses related to the Banks new overdraft privilege product and a 133 percent increase in charitable contributions. Non interest expense increased $685,000, or 4 percent in 2005, when compared to 2004. Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased only $12,000 or less than 1 percent from 2004 to 2005. This was due to increases in salaries being offset by a reduction in the cost of providing health care to employees. The Companys medical plan is self insured and medical claims and participation fluctuate from year to year. Occupancy and equipment costs declined $73,000 in 2005, compared to 2004. This was due to a decline in depreciation expense on equipment that had become fully depreciated in 2005. Data processing and software expenses increased $93,000 or 7 percent in 2005. This was the result of continued investment in technology upgrades to remain competitive and to maintain existing systems. Total professional and legal fees, printing and supplies, marketing and other expenses increased $563,000 or 18 percent in 2005, compared to 2004. This was largely due to additional expenses related to the name change of the Bank. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $2,893,000 in 2006, compared with $2,478,000 in 2005 and $1,753,000 in 2004. The Companys effective tax rate approximated 29 percent in 2006, 29 percent in 2005 and 28 percent in 2004. 30 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital Capital provides the foundation for future growth and expansion. The major component of capital is stockholders equity. Stockholders equity was $65.8 million as of December 31, 2006, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9 percent from a year ago. The increase resulted primarily from the retention of earnings. The Company expects to fund future growth from current capital and retention of future earnings. In 2006, the Company declared cash dividends totaling $2.0 million, approximately 29 percent of earnings. In 2005, the Company declared cash dividends totaling $1.6 million, or approximately 26 percent of earnings. Capital Resources (in thousands) Under the regulatory risk based capital guidelines in effect for both banks and bank holding companies, minimum capital levels are based upon perceived risk in the Companys various asset categories. These guidelines assign risk weights to on balance sheet and off balance sheet categories in arriving at total risk adjusted assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the computed total of risk adjusted assets to arrive at the minimum levels prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board as of December 31, 2006, as shown in the table below: Regulatory Requirements December 31, AdequatelyCapitalized WellCapitalized 2006 2005 Tier 1 capital $ 65,897 $ 60,853 Tier 2 capital 7,325 6,388 Total qualifying capital $ 73,222 $ 67,241 Tier 1 leverage ratio 4 % 5 % 9.97 % 10.40 % Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 11.24 % 11.92 % Total risk based capital 8 % 10 % 12.49 % 13.17 % Interest Rate Risk The primary components of the balance sheet are interest earning assets, which are funded by interest bearing liabilities. The differences in cash flows of these rate sensitive assets and liabilities, combined with shifts, or changes in the overall market yield curve result in interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the change in net interest income due to interest rate changes. Interest rate risk is inherent to banking and cannot be eliminated. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for overseeing the financial management of net interest income, liquidity, investment activities, and other related activities. In regard to interest rate risk, management has relied on re pricing GAP analysis, which is a traditional method of assessing interest rate risk. Recognizing that there is no single measure that absolutely measures current or future risk, management also relies on a simulation analysis to assess risk in dynamic interest rate environments. 31 Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates The following table shows the amount of total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which based on scheduled maturity dates, are due in the periods indicated: Maturing(in thousands) 1 year or less 1 5 years After 5 years Total Residential Real Estate $ 7,615 $ 25,478 $ 53,238 $ 86,331 Installment 1,953 9,088 6,268 17,309 Commercial Real Estate 93,616 158,563 51,258 303,437 Other Commercial 60,132 41,755 5,574 107,461 Totals $ 163,316 $ 234,884 $ 116,338 $ 514,538 Allowance for Loan Losses (7,510 ) Total Loans Receivable, Net $ 507,028 Below is a schedule of the amounts maturing or re pricing as of December 31, 2006, which are classified according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates: Interest Sensitivity(in thousands) Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Due within 3 months $ 2,296 $ 240,860 $ 243,156 Due after 3 months within 1 year 14,190 2,801 16,991 Due after one but within five years 167,786 1,549 169,335 Due after five years 84,901 155 85,056 Total $ 269,173 $ 245,365 $ 514,538 Allowance for loan losses (7,510 ) Total loans receivable, net $ 507,028 32 Asset/Liability Gap Position (in thousands) December 31, 2006 0 3 Months 4 12 Months 1 5 Years 5+ Years Total Assets: Fed Funds Sold $ $ $ $ $ Loans 247,993 41,831 173,118 51,596 514,538 Securities (including restricted investments) 24,427 24,757 50,840 19,656 119,680 Loans held for sale 1,620 1,620 Other assets, net 33,534 Total Assets $ 274,040 $ 66,588 $ 223,958 $ 71,252 $ 669,372 Liabilities and Equity: Savings & NOW $ 169,842 $ 2,611 $ 13,927 $ 27,462 $ 213,842 Time 100,238 120,386 59,858 280,482 Total deposits 270,080 122,997 73,785 27,462 494,324 Other borrowings 8,050 1,664 21,573 31,287 Non interest bearing deposits 72,683 Other liabilities 5,257 Stockholders equity 65,821 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 278,130 $ 124,661 $ 95,358 $ 27,462 $ 669,372 Rate sensitivity gap and ratios: Gap for period $(4,090 ) $(58,073 ) $ 128,600 $ 43,790 Cumulative gap $(4,090 ) $(62,163 ) $ 66,437 $ 110,227 Period gap ratio 0.99 0.53 2.35 2.59 Cumulative gap ratio 0.99 0.85 1.13 1.21 Gap /Total Earning assets Period (1.5 %) (87.2 %) 57.4 % 61.5 % Cumulative (1.5 %) (18.2 %) 11.8 % 17.3 % The asset/liability gap reflects the projected repayment and maturities of the Banks loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. Management has made a number of assumptions to improve the usefulness of the gap analysis and to manage interest rate risk. The assumptions include, but are not limited to, prepayments on loans, repayment speeds on certain investment securities, and the likelihood of certain call and put features on financial instruments being exercised. Management attempts to reflect the sensitivity of assets and liabilities; however, customer behavior in different rate and economic environments is not entirely predictable. As such, interest rate risk cannot be eliminated. As of December 31, 2006 the cumulative one year liability gap position was approximately 18 percent of earning assets. The previous table reflects that the Bank has a liability repricing gap of approximately $4 million at 3 months and a liability repricing gap of $62 million at one year. Management recognizes that GAP analysis alone is not a reliable measure of interest rate risk. Management is comfortable with the Banks current GAP position and interest rate exposure and will continue to monitor the Banks sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Management regularly reviews the asset liability gap position and other available information to manage the overall interest rate risk of the Bank. 33 Market Risk The Bank complements its stable core deposit base with alternate sources of funds, which include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, brokered certificates of deposit from outside its market area and federal funds purchased. Management evaluates the funding needs and makes a decision, whether to fund internally or from alternate sources, based on current interest rates and terms. To date, the Bank has not employed the use of derivative financial instruments in managing the risk of changes in interest rates.

(2) Simulation analyses calculates the change in net interest income, under parallel shifts in interest rates over the next 12 months based on a static balance sheet. Simulation models are useful tools, but require numerous assumptions that have a significant impact on the measured interest rate risk. The use of simulation models requires numerous assumptions, which could impact the results. Simulation models require the ability to accurately predict customer behavior to interest rate changes, changes in the competitive environment and other economic factors. Liquidity Liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits, borrowed funds, capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities. These funds are used to meet deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, fund loans and operate our Company. Liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale, matured securities, and federal funds sold. Asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximizes profitability, while providing adequate liquidity. The Companys liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits, and other borrowed funds and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity. The growth of the Banks loan portfolio during 2006 was primarily funded through deposit growth. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank declined by $4 million, federal funds purchased declined by $3 million, the use of brokered certificates of deposit declined by $17 million and certificates of deposit over $100,000 (excluding brokered deposits) increased by $46 million as of December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. The Bank has the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks using established federal funds purchased lines. The Bank has established unsecured federal funds purchased borrowing limits totaling $55 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Bank had $3 million in federal funds purchased. During 2006, the Banks federal funds purchased position averaged $5.5 million and its federal funds sold position averaged $4.7 million. In addition, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLBI), the Bank has access to FHLBIs borrowing programs. As of December 31, 2006, FHLB advances totaled $24.2 million and, based on available collateral, the Bank could borrow up to an additional $13.0 million. 34 Net cash flows from operating activities fluctuate sharply from year to year due to the dollar amount of mortgage loans originated and the amount of mortgage loans sold. The changes from 2005 to 2006 and from 2004 to 2005 are largely due to mortgage loan related activity. Cash flows from investment activities reflect cash used to fund the increase in total loans, cash received from the maturity and sale of available for sale securities and the reinvestment of that cash through the purchase of new securities. The changes in cash flows from investment activities are mainly the result of the growth of the Banks loan portfolio. Total loans increased by $61 million from 2005 to 2006 compared to an increase of $45 million from 2004 to 2005. Net cash flows from financing activities reflect the increases or decreases in the products used to fund the loan growth of the Bank. The change in cash flows from financing activities reflects an increase in the Banks total deposits of $79 million, a decrease in FHLB borrowings of $4 million, and a decrease in federal funds purchased of $3 million. The Companys cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $1 million during 2006 to $14 million at December 31, 2006. Overall liquidity is primarily determined by deposit and loan growth in addition to borrowing and security investment activity.

Impact of Inflation The majority of assets and liabilities of financial institutions are monetary in nature. Generally, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact than inflation on the earnings of the Bank. Although influenced by inflation, changes in rates do not necessarily move in either the same magnitude or direction as changes in the price of goods and services. Inflation does impact the growth of total assets, creating a need to increase equity capital at a higher rate to maintain an adequate equity to assets ratio, which in turn reduces the amount of earnings available for cash dividends. 35 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited): (in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Periods Ended, 2006 Total Assets $ 618,730 $ 628,597 $ 667,846 $ 669,372 Net Interest Income 5600 5,772 5,811 5,796 Provision for Loan Losses 120 180 120 120 Net Income $ 1,567 $ 1,690 $ 1,877 $ 1,888 Earnings per Share $ 0.64 $ 0.69 $ 0.76 $ 0.77 Book Value per Share $ 25.01 $ 25.27 $ 26.17 $ 26.78 Return on Average Assets 1.06 % 1.08 % 1.16 % 1.13 % Return on Stockholders Equity 10.37 % 10.94 % 11.74 % 11.48 % Efficiency Ratio 65.3 % 63.8 % 61.9 % 62.7 % Periods Ended, 2005 Total Assets $ 558,167 $ 566,155 $ 580,521 $ 591,085 Net Interest Income 4,786 5,079 5,482 5,821 Provision for Loan Losses 120 120 120 120 Net Income $ 1,238 $ 1,410 $ 1,675 $ 1,735 Earnings per Share $ 0.50 $ 0.57 $ 0.68 $ 0.71 Book Value per Share $ 23.36 $ 23.39 $ 24.33 $ 24.66 Return on Average Assets 0.91 % 1.01 % 1.17 % 1.18 % Return on Stockholders Equity 8.70 % 9.68 % 11.18 % 11.44 % Efficiency Ratio 68.0 % 66.1 % 62.6 % 62.9 % ITEM 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A derivative financial instrument includes futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, option contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. The Company currently does not enter into futures, forwards, swaps, or options. However, the Company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the Company. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions. Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the Company until the instrument is exercised. The Companys exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee (See Market Risk from Item 7). Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to manage the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize these risks. Tools used by management include the standard GAP report and a simulation model. The Company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.
