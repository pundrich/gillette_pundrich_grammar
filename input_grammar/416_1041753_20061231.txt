ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. It is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. The discussion set forth below contains certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Companys actual results to materially differ from those projected in the forwarding looking statements. For further information regarding forward looking statements, you should review the discussion under the caption FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS on page 1 of this report. OVERVIEW OF PERFORMANCE The Company derives substantially all of its revenue and income from community bank related activities. The Bank operates as a typical community banking institution and does not engage in any specialized finance or capital markets activities. Northway functions primarily as the holder of stock of its subsidiary and assists in the management of the operations of its subsidiary as appropriate. The principal components of the Companys income sources are net interest and dividend income. Net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest, dividends and fee income received on interest earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Our other sources of income include revenues from sales of securities, deposit account service fees and fee based services, such as debit card fees, ATM fees and alternative investment income. Economic and industry factors that could cause the Companys financial performance to differ from expected results include changes in applicable federal and state regulations, changes in the hospitality industry on which the Companys business is largely dependent, interest rate volatility, significant changes in loan losses which may affect the Companys allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses, and changes in the securities market that would affect the performance of the Companys investment portfolio. Management evaluates each of these factors on an ongoing basis to determine their impact and to effect any strategies necessary to mitigate these risks. The Company reported net income of $3,215,000, or $2.15 basic earnings per common share, in 2006 compared to net income of $2,673,000, or $1.78 basic earnings per common share, in 2005 and $3,388,000, or $2.26 basic earnings per common share, in 2004. Return on average equity was 6.24% in 2006, compared to 5.33% in 2005 and 6.97% in 2004. Return on average assets was 0.51% in 2006, compared to 0.43% in 2005 and 0.54% in 2004. On April 7, 2006, the Company acquired from Washington Mutual Bank the former Providian National Bank branches located in Tilton and Belmont, New Hampshire. This transaction included the purchase of approximately $8,192,000 in loan balances, net of discount, and the acquisition of deposits, net of deposit assumption premium, totaling approximately $27,779,000, for which the Company paid a deposit assumption premium of 6.30%. See NOTE 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2006, the Company recorded a decrease in net interest and dividend income of $974,000, as an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 0.92% was only partially offset by an increase in the yield on earning assets of 0.65% and an increase in average earning assets of $9,026,000. During 2006, interest income increased $3,863,000 due primarily to an improvement in the yield on loans as well as an increase in both the yield and average balances of investments. Interest expense increased $4,837,000 due primarily to an increase in interest bearing liabilities of $10,079,000 as well as a shift in liabilities from savings and NOW accounts, a less expensive source of funds, into certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, more costly sources of funds. The provision for loan losses increased $390,000 as the total provision for 2006 was $465,000 compared to $75,000 for 2005. The increase in the provision for loan losses was the result of the ongoing review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, increased $930,000 from last year due primarily to an increase in overdraft income, debit card fees and one time favorable items relating to the resolution of a significant loan relationship workout as well as unwind fee income from a FHLBB symmetrical advance. During 2006, the Company realized net securities gains of $394,000 compared to net securities losses of $551,000 for the prior year. The 2005 net losses were the result of the restructuring of the investment portfolio as well as the sale of corporate bonds at a loss of $499,000. Noninterest expense increased $159,000 over the prior year. Table of Contents During 2005, the Company recorded an increase in net interest and dividend income of $330,000, as an increase in the average yield on earning assets of 0.33% and an increase in average earning assets of $2,079,000 was only partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 0.31%. During 2005, interest income increased $1,827,000 due primarily to an improvement in the yield on loans as well as an increase in investment balances. Partially offsetting this, interest expense increased $1,497,000 as money market and certificates of deposit rates increased, keeping pace with the rise in interest rates. The Company recorded a reduction in the provision for loan losses of $420,000 as the total provision for 2005 was $75,000 compared to $495,000 for 2004. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was the result of an ongoing review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, increased $203,000 from last year due primarily to improvements in overdraft income, commissions on alternative investments and debit card fees, which was partially offset by decreases in gains on sales of loans and loan fees. During 2005, the Company realized net securities losses totaling $551,000 compared to net securities gains of $753,000 for the prior year. These net losses in 2005 were the result of the restructuring of the investment portfolio as well as the sale of corporate bonds at a loss of $499,000. Noninterest expense increased $1,188,000 due primarily to one time costs of $1,161,000 associated with the merger of the two banks. NET INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ANALYSIS Fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in volume and mix of income earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest and dividend income, the principal source of our income. The discussion of net interest and dividend income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis, unless otherwise noted, to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets. The table below under the caption Consolidated Average Balances, Interest and Dividend Income/Expense and Average Yields/Rates, presents the average balances, income earned or interest paid, and average yields earned or rates paid on the Companys assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Net interest and dividend income for 2006 decreased $487,000, or 2%, compared to 2005. Interest and dividend income increased $4,350,000, or 13%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Rising interest rates and a shift in the loan mix resulted in an improvement on the yield on loans of 0.65%. Further the average balance on investments increased $14,266,000 and the yield on investments increased 0.66% resulting in an improvement in investment income of $1,419,000. The increase in interest income was more than offset by an increase in interest expense of $4,837,000, or 54%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest expense increased due primarily to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 0.92%. This increase was the result of an increase in rates paid on money market accounts, certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances and junior subordinated debentures. These rates increased as a result of the increase in interest rates during 2006. Further, the Company experienced a shift in liabilities from lower costing savings and NOW accounts into money markets, certificates of deposit and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, more expensive sources of funds. Net interest and dividend income for 2005 increased $489,000, or 2%, compared to 2004. Interest and dividend income increased $1,986,000, or 7%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Rising interest rates resulted in an improvement in the yield on loans of 0.42% which was partially offset by a decline in average balances of $19,824,000, resulting in an increase in interest and fees on loans of $821,000. Further, the average balance of investments increased $23,097,000 resulting in an improvement in investment income of $966,000. In 2005 the increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $1,497,000, or 20%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Interest expense increased due primarily to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 0.31%. This increase was the result of an increase in rates paid on money market accounts, certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and junior subordinated debentures. These rates increased as a result of the increase in general interest rates during 2005. The trend in net interest and dividend income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using net interest margin and interest rate spread. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest and dividend income by average total earning assets. This ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets, including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds. The net interest margin decreased 0.14% to 3.92% in 2006 after having increased 0.07% to 4.06% in 2005. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2006 was a direct result of the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities, which increase was only partially offset by an increase in the yield on earning assets. The increase in the net interest margin for 2005 was a direct result of the increase in the yield on earning assets, which increase was only partially offset by the increase in the cost of funds. The interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of interest rate fluctuations. During 2006, the net interest rate spread decreased 0.27% to 3.53% as the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 0.92% and was only partially offset by an increase in the yield on earning assets of 0.65% During 2005, the net interest rate spread increased 0.02% to 3.80% as the yield on earning assets increased 0.33% and was only partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 0.31%. See the tables below under the captions Consolidated Average Balances, Interest and Dividend Income/Expense and Average Yields/Rates and Consolidated Rate/Volume Variance Analysis for more information. Table of Contents PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses represents the annual cost of providing an allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The size of the provision for each year is determined by management based upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, managements assessment of loan portfolio quality, the value of collateral and general economic factors. The provision for loan losses was $465,000 in 2006, an increase of $390,000 from the provision recorded in 2005. The provision for loan losses was $75,000 in 2005, a decrease of $420,000 from the provision recorded in 2004. The provision for each of the three years was based upon a review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is conducted on a quarterly basis. This review is based upon many factors, including the risk characteristics of the portfolio, trends in loan delinquencies, and an assessment of existing economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review the Companys allowances for loan losses and such review may result in changes to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management. The increase in the 2006 provision was due in large part to an increase in commercial loans, especially large hospitality loans, which require a higher risk weighting in the allowance for loan loss calculation. The decrease in the 2005 provision was due in part to a reduction in average loans of $19,824,000, which was primarily the result of a decrease in average indirect installment loans which declined $53,234,000. Although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses, there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to change its provision for loan losses in subsequent periods. Management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and modify the provision to the allowance for loan losses as appropriate. For additional information regarding estimates in the assessment of the allowance for loan losses see Application of Critical Accounting Policies below.

NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities, including fee based services and income earned through securities sales. The following table sets forth the components of the Companys noninterest income: ($000 Omitted) Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Service charges and fees on deposit accounts $ 2,837 $ 2,430 $ 2,229 Gain (loss) on sales of securities available for sale, net 394 (551 ) 753 Debit card fees 557 456 372 Gain on sales of loans, net 137 260 374 Other 1,946 1,401 1,369 Total noninterest income $ 5,871 $ 3,996 $ 5,097 Fee income from service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased 17% in 2006, 9% in 2005 and 33% in 2004. The improvement in 2006 was due primarily to an increase in overdraft income due to a 20% increase in the insufficient funds (NSF) per item fees in May 2006 as well as the impact of the two branches acquired April 7, 2006. The improvement in 2005 was due primarily to an increase in overdraft income due to the full year impact of the introduction of Bounce Protection, an overdraft privilege program, in April 2004. The improvement in 2004 was due principally to increases in the per item insufficient fund fee as the Company introduced new fee schedules in December 2003. In addition, 2004 overdraft income was positively impacted by the introduction of Bounce Protection. Table of Contents During 2006, the Company recognized a net gain on sales of securities of $394,000 compared to a net loss on sales of securities of $551,000 in 2005 and a net gain on sales of securities of $753,000 in 2004. Securities gains in 2006 were primarily the result of an improved equity market in 2006. Securities losses in 2005 were primarily due to the restructuring of the investment portfolio, which resulted in the sale of U.S. Government Agency bonds at a loss, as well as the sale of corporate bonds at a loss of $499,000. Securities gains in 2004 were the result of improved market conditions for investment securities. Securities gains, net, in 2006 included $440,000 of net gains on sales of equity securities compared to $117,000 and $253,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net losses on the sales of debt securities totaled $46,000 in 2006 compared to net losses of $668,000 in 2005 and net gains of $500,000 in 2004. Debit card fees were $557,000 in 2006 compared to $456,000 in 2005 and $372,000 in 2004. The $101,000 increase in debit card fees in 2006 and $84,000 in 2005 reflects the increase in debit card usage over the past several years. Gains on sales of loans, net, decreased $123,000 in 2006 compared to 2005 as gains on sales of mortgage loans declined $52,000 to $77,000 and the Company recorded no gain on the sale of commercial loans in 2006 compared to $68,000 in 2005. Gains on sales of loans, net, decreased $114,000 in 2005 compared to 2004. Gains on sales of mortgage loans remained relatively unchanged at $112,000 from the prior year. Gains on sales of commercial loans declined $109,000 during 2004 as the Company sold a portfolio of commercial loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration for a gain of $178,000. Gains on sales of loans, net, decreased $48,000 in 2004 compared to 2003. Gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased $228,000 as the Company opted to retain a greater portion of fixed rate mortgages in portfolio in 2004 compared to 2003. This was partially offset by the Companys sale of a portfolio of commercial loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration for a gain of $178,000 in 2004. Other noninterest income (sources of which include credit card merchant income, ATM fees, loan fees, safe deposit fees and commissions on alternative investment products) increased $545,000, or 39%, to $1,946,000 in 2006 following an increase of $32,000, or 2%, to $1,401,000 in 2005 and a decrease of $72,000, or 5%, to $1,369,000 in 2004. The increase in 2006 was due primarily to an increase in income from alternative investment products, an increase in the valuation of the cash surrender value of a company owned life insurance and several one time favorable items relating to the recapture of prior years interest and expenses on the payoff of a large commercial loan workout totaling $100,000, gains on sale of OREO property of $86,000 as well as an unwind fee of $84,000 from the redemption of a FHLBB symmetrical advance. The increase in 2005 was due primarily to an increase in income from alternative investments products as well as an increase in debit card income. The decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was due primarily to the recognition of approximately $191,000 in other loan fees resulting from transactions with Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). This decrease was partially offset by the introduction of alternative investment products offered by the Company, which increased fee income by approximately $126,000. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense increased $159,000, or 1%, during 2006 following an increase of $1,188,000, or 5%, during 2005 and an increase $258,000, or 1%, during 2004. During 2006, noninterest expense was impacted by the expenses associated with the acquisition of the two branches in April 2006 as well as increased fees paid to our outsourced marketing firm. The increase in expenses during 2005 is due primarily to one time expenses of $1,161,000 resulting from the merger of the Companys two subsidiary banks. The increase in expenses during 2004 was due primarily to an increase in salaries and employee benefits. The following table sets forth information relating to the Companys noninterest expense during the periods indicated: ($000 Omitted) Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Salaries and employee benefits $ 12,252 $ 11,633 $ 12,058 Office occupancy and equipment 4,190 4,282 3,873 Amortization of core deposit intangibles 1,051 954 954 Professional fees 1,026 1,179 907 Marketing 726 757 326 Stationery and supplies 365 647 429 Telecommunications 455 619 595 Other 3,676 3,511 3,252 Total noninterest expense $ 23,741 $ 23,582 $ 22,394 The merger related expenses, which totaled $1,161,000 for 2005, consisted primarily of advertising expense of $386,000, stationery and supplies of $337,000, equipment expense of $141,000, professional fees of $83,000, legal fees of $81,000 and state transfer tax of $71,000. These one time costs related to marketing the Northway brand, replacing all existing forms, replacing all existing signage, transfer of real estate, and all necessary legal and computer systems issues related to the merger. These expenses are included in the table above in the appropriate expense categories. Salaries and employee benefits increased $619,000, or 5%, from 2005 to 2006 and decreased $425,000, or 4%, from 2004 to 2005. The increase in 2006 was attributable primarily to increases in health and dental insurance, pension expense and the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP ) as well as one time separation expenses from the centralization of consumer lending. The decrease in 2005 was due primarily to a focus on staffing levels, an increase in SFAS No. 91 credits associated with deferred loan origination costs, and a decrease in the expense related to the SERP. The increase in 2004 reflected staff additions in connection with the expansion of the retail franchise, increased lending activities and normal salary and wage increases. Also, during 2004, the Company recorded a liability to deferred compensation related to the SERP. Refer to NOTE 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion regarding the SERP. Table of Contents Office occupancy and equipment expense decreased $92,000 from 2005 to 2006. Further, 2005 included one time merger related expenses of $141,000. The primary reason for the decrease of $233,000, net of merger related expenses, was the decrease in occupancy depreciation expense, leases and property maintenance partially offset by an increase in equipment depreciation and maintenance expense. Office occupancy and equipment expenses increased $268,000, net of merger related expenses of $141,000, during 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in 2005 was due primarily to increases in building maintenance costs as well as one time expenses associated with the write down of leasehold improvements associated with the closure of two supermarket branch facilities. The amortization of core deposit intangibles increased $97,000 from 2005 to 2006 due to the core deposit intangibles amortization associated with the two branches acquired in April 2006. There was no change from 2004 to 2005. Marketing expense increased $355,000, net of merger related expenses of $386,000, during 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, the Company expanded upon its relationship with an outsourced marketing firm, in connection with an effort to increase deposit balances. Telecommunications expenses decreased $164,000 from 2005 to 2006 due to a change in service providers. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Company recognized $652,000, $842,000 and $1,666,000 in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rate was 16.9% for 2006, 24.0% for 2005 and 33.0% for 2004. For additional information relating to income taxes, see NOTE 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASSETS Total assets increased $18,143,000, or 3%, to $650,877,000 at December 31, 2006 compared to $632,734,000 at December 31, 2005. The following is a summary of significant balance sheet changes. ($000 Omitted) December 31 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Total assets $ 650,877 $ 632,734 $ 18,143 2.9 % Earning assets 602,320 582,558 19,762 3.4 Federal funds sold 8,755 14,775 (6,020 ) (40.7 ) Securities available for sale, at fair value (1) 131,571 108,785 22,786 21.0 Loans, net of unamortized cost/unearned income 462,230 460,373 1,857 0.4 Deposits 484,677 464,456 20,221 4.4 Borrowings 110,117 114,983 (4,866 ) (4.2 ) Stockholders equity 52,149 50,250 1,899 3.8 (1) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock The increase in earning assets of $19,762,000 was due primarily to an increase in securities available for sale partially offset by a decrease in federal funds sold. The increase in earning assets was accompanied by an increase in deposits which was partially offset by a decrease in borrowings. SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE The Companys securities are classified into one of two categories based on managements intent to hold the securities: (i) held to maturity securities, or (ii) securities available for sale. Securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2006 and 2005 the Company had no securities designated as held to maturity. The following table summarizes the Companys securities portfolio at December 31, 2006 and 2005 showing amortized cost and fair value for each category: ($000 Omitted) December 31, 2006 2005 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities $ 47,738 $ 47,063 $ 48,728 $ 47,751 Mortgage backed securities 40,905 40,615 24,704 23,931 Collateralized mortgage obligations 6 6 8 8 Marketable equity securities 3,364 3,617 2,695 2,809 Corporate bonds 3,517 3,522 5,541 5,569 Asset backed securities 4,974 4,968 State and political subdivision bonds and notes 27,784 27,998 23,396 23,176 Total securities available for sale $ 128,288 $ 127,789 $ 105,072 $ 103,244 Table of Contents Total securities available for sale increased $24,545,000 during 2006 to $127,789,000 as a result of the growth in funding sources. The Company purchased mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and state and political subdivision bonds and notes. The net unrealized loss on securities available for sale was $499,000 at December 31, 2006 compared to a net unrealized loss of $1,828,000 at December 31, 2005 due primarily to the continued level of low interest rates, which increases the value of our security holdings. At December 31, 2006, the net unrealized loss on debt securities was $752,000 and the net unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $253,000. At December 31, 2005, the net unrealized loss on debt securities was $1,942,000 and the net unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $114,000. At December 31, 2006, the Companys investment in equity securities totaled $3,617,000. This amount is net of a market value adjustment of $253,000, of which the full amount was reflected as a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. The Company has a general policy of purchasing investment grade securities and U.S. government securities to minimize credit risk. All securities, however, carry interest rate risk, which affect their market values such that as market yields increase, the value of the Companys securities decline and vice versa. Additionally, mortgage backed securities carry prepayment risk whereby expected yields may not be achieved due to the inability to reinvest proceeds from prepayment at comparable yields. Moreover, such mortgage backed securities may not benefit from price appreciation in periods of declining rates to the same extent as the remainder of the portfolio. A portion of the securities portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances and treasury, tax and loan accounts. Refer to NOTE 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of pledging of securities. LOANS Gross loans increased $1,662,000, or 0.4%, to $461,951,000 at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. This increase was due primarily to an increase in commercial real estate, residential real estate, commercial and installment loans , which was partially offset by a decrease in indirect installment loans of $33,507,000. Gross loans decreased $14,523,000, or 3%, to $460,289,000 at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in indirect installment loans of $54,299,000, which was partially offset by increases in residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction loans and installment loans. The following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006 and 2005: ($000 Omitted) 2006 Percent of Total 2005 Percent of Total Real estate: Residential $ 167,172 36.2 % $ 158,729 34.5 % Commercial 158,464 34.3 143,456 31.1 Construction 10,700 2.3 13,241 2.9 Commercial 33,569 7.3 27,349 6.0 Installment 42,489 9.2 35,786 7.8 Indirect installment 28,714 6.2 62,221 13.5 Other 20,843 4.5 19,507 4.2 $ 461,951 100.0 % $ 460,289 100.0 % During 2006, the loan portfolio mix continued to shift as runoff from the indirect installment loan portfolio was redeployed into residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial and installment loans. Further, during 2006 the Company purchased loans totaling $8,192,000, net of discount, as part of the branch acquisition. These loans were comprised of commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Residential real estate loans increased to account for 36.2% of the portfolio from 34.5% at December 31, 2005 due in part to the decision to retain high credit quality fixed rate mortgages in the portfolio rather than sell in the secondary market. Commercial real estate and construction loans now comprise 34.3% and 2.3%, respectively of total loans compared to 31.1% and 2.9%, respectively at December 31, 2005 due to the continued efforts of our seasoned commercial lenders. Installment loans comprise 9.2% of the loan portfolio compared to 7.8% a year ago due primarily to an increase in fixed rate home improvement loans. Indirect installment loans, which originations were discontinued in August 2004, now comprise 6.2% of total loans compared to 13.5% at December 31, 2005. Commercial real estate loans consist of loans secured by income producing and owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial loans consist of loans that are either unsecured or are secured by inventories, receivables or other corporate assets, and some are additionally secured by a guarantee of the federal Small Business Administration. Commercial real estate and commercial loans increased by $21,228,000 in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Company continues to emphasize commercial real estate and commercial loans in order to enhance earnings and maintain the balance of its portfolio. Residential real estate loans increased by $8,443,000, a 5% increase from 2005, compared to an increase of $11,396,000, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company originates both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential loans for its portfolio. Some fixed rate residential loans are originated for sale to investors in the secondary market. The increase in residential real estate loans in 2006 resulted primarily from the Companys decision to retain a greater percentage of fixed rate residential mortgage loans. During 2006, installment loan balances increased $6,703,000, or 19%, from 2005, compared to an increase of $6,441,000, or 22%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Indirect installment loans decreased by $33,507,000, or 54%, in 2006 compared to a decrease of $54,299,000, or 47%, in 2005. Table of Contents NONPERFORMING ASSETS Nonperforming assets were $3,714,000, or 0.57%, of total assets, at December 31, 2006 compared to $3,321,000, or 0.53% of total assets, at December 31, 2005, an increase of $393,000, or 12%. Nonperforming assets are comprised primarily of nonaccrual loans, other chattels owned and real estate acquired by foreclosure or a similar conveyance of title. The accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when there is reasonable doubt as to its collectibility or whenever the payment of principal or interest is more than 90 days past due. However, there are loans within this nonaccrual classification that provide periodic payments, but which have a weakness with respect to the collateral securing the loan. At December 31, 2006, nonaccrual loans totaled $3,698,000, or 0.80% of total loans, compared to $3,013,000, or 0.66% of total loans, in 2005. At December 31, 2006 the Company had no other real estate owned compared to $196,000 at December 31, 2005 Other chattels owned decreased $96,000 to $16,000 at December 31, 2006 compared to $112,000 at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, gross interest income that would have been recorded for the year had the loans been current in accordance with their original terms totaled approximately $393,000. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recognized interest income on these non accrual loans of $353,000. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. When a loan, or portion thereof, is considered uncollectible, it is charged against the allowance. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance when collected. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience, current economic conditions and their effect on borrowers and the market area in general, and the performance of individual credits in relation to the contract terms. In addition various federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the adequacy of the Companys allowance for loan losses. For additional information regarding estimates in the assessment of the allowance for loan losses see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses below. The Companys allowance for loan losses increased $431,000 from December 31, 2005 to $5,581,000, or 1.21% of total loans, at December 31, 2006. The following table sets forth the activity of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated: ($000 Omitted) Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Beginning allowance $ 5,150 $ 5,204 $ 5,036 Provision for loan losses 465 75 495 Loans charged off (332 ) (415 ) (665 ) Recoveries on loans previously charged off 298 286 338 Net charge offs (34 ) (129 ) (327 ) Ending allowance $ 5,581 $ 5,150 $ 5,204 Allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding 1.21 % 1.12 % 1.10 % Allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans 150.92 170.93 181.51 Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans 0.01 0.03 0.07 DEPOSITS Total deposits at December 31, 2006 were $484,677,000, an increase of $20,221,000, or 4%, compared to $464,456,000 at December 31, 2005. The increase in deposits was due primarily to the deposits acquired, net of premium, of $29,438,000 in April 2006. Certificates of deposit increased $46,610,000 and were partially offset by decreases in demand, savings, NOW and money market deposits of $26,389,000. The following table sets forth the components of deposits for the periods indicated: ($000 Omitted) December 31, 2006 2005 Demand $ 72,054 $ 77,436 Regular savings, NOW and money market 217,682 238,689 Time 194,941 148,331 Total deposits $ 484,677 $ 464,456 At December 31, 2006, time deposits of $100,000 or more are scheduled to mature as follows: ($000 Omitted) 3 months or less $ 17,084 Over 3 to 6 months 24,461 Over 6 to 12 months 13,054 Over 12 months 1,077 $ 55,676 Table of Contents BORROWINGS At December 31, 2006 short term borrowings consisted of securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $36,497,000 compared to $9,363,000 for 2005. Long term debt in 2006 consists of FHLB term advances of $53,000,000 as well as $20,620,000 of junior subordinated debentures, compared to $85,000,000 of FHLB term advances and $20,620,000 of junior subordinated debentures in 2005. Two of the long term term FHLB advances are callable quarterly with their next call dates in March and December 2007. The decrease in FHLB advances is the result of the maturity and redemption of $56,000,000 in advances partially offset by new advances totaling $24,000,000. Junior subordinated debentures consist of two issues of floating rate trust preferred securities acquired during April and July 2002 in the amount of $7,217,000 and $13,403,000, respectively, due in 2032. These trust preferred securities were offered for the purpose of providing capital to the subsidiary bank to ensure adequate capital following branch acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2006, of the $20,620,000 principal amount outstanding, $17,209,000 qualified as Tier 1 capital and $3,411,000 was allocated to Tier 2 capital. See NOTES 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Companys borrowings. The following table sets forth certain information concerning the Companys borrowings at the dates indicated: ($000 Omitted) December 31, 2006 2005 Short term borrowings $ 36,497 $ 9,363 Long term debt 73,620 105,620 $ 110,117 $ 114,983 At December 31, 2006, long term debt is scheduled to mature as follows: ($000 Omitted) Less than one year $ 13,000 After one year through three years 19,000 After three year through five years 7,000 Over five years 34,620 $ 73,620 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. The Companys exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for balance sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off balance sheet credit risk at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $92,220,000 and $81,970,000, respectively. See NOTE 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding off balance sheet arrangements. Table of Contents CAPITAL The Companys stockholders equity serves to support growth and provide depositors and other creditors protection against loss. Equity capital represents the stockholders investment in the Company. Management strives to maintain an optimal level of capital on which an attractive return to the stockholders will be realized over both the short term and long term, while serving depositors and creditors needs. The Company must also observe the minimum requirements enforced by the federal banking regulators. There are three capital requirements that banks and bank holding companies must meet: Tier 1 capital, total capital (combination of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital), and leverage (Tier 1 capital to average assets) ratios. Tier 1 capital consists of stockholders equity, net of intangible assets as well as a portion of junior subordinated debentures. Tier 2 capital consists of a limited amount of allowance for loan losses and the portion of junior subordinated debentures not allocated to Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage ratios do not include any adjustments for unrealized gains and losses relating to securities available for sale except net unrealized losses relating to marketable equity securities. The minimum requirements for the leverage ratio, risk based Tier 1 capital and risk based total capital are 4%, 4% and 8%, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Bank was well capitalized as defined under FDIC regulations. The following table sets forth the Companys risk based capital and leverage ratios: ($000 Omitted) December 31, 2006 2005 Risk adjusted assets $ 416,735 $ 426,731 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) 9.31 % 8.96 % Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 14.02 13.07 Total capital (to risk weighted assets) 15.95 15.24 Total stockholders equity includes a $1,256,000 negative adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2006 and a $1,104,000 negative adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006 this adjustment was comprised of a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of taxes, of $301,000, a $1,382,000 unrealized loss on pension valuation, net of tax and a $427,000 unrealized credit on prior pension service cost. At December 31, 2005, this adjustment was comprised solely of a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of taxes. The Company intends to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis subject to the financial condition and earnings of the Company, capital requirements, and other factors, including applicable governmental regulations. No dividends will be payable unless declared by the Board of Directors and then only to the extent funds are legally available for the payment of such dividends. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in NOTE 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in NOTE 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Companys most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses, which is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses, is estimated at the Bank based on estimates of losses related to customer loan balances. In establishing the appropriate provisions, the Company makes assumptions with respect to the future collectibility of customer loan balances. The Companys assumptions are based on an individual assessment of the customers credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the credit rating of the loans. Generally, these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider (a) the customers ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments; (b) a customers current and projected financial condition; (c) the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook; and (d) the economy in general. Once the Company considers all of these factors, a determination is made as to the probability of default. An appropriate provision is made, which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding loan balances based on the Companys experience in collecting these amounts. The Companys level of allowance for loan losses fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses. Table of Contents Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, the Company is required to perform annual impairment tests of its goodwill and intangible assets and more frequently in certain circumstances. The Company has elected to test for goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. In that goodwill is carried on the books of the Bank and the Company owns 100% of its outstanding stock, there is no market value for its common stock. The Company utilizes a multiple of earnings approach in analyzing the valuation of goodwill. Core deposit intangibles are carried on the books of the Bank as well. The valuation of core deposit intangibles incorporate deposits acquired compared with current deposit levels, considers deposit outflow assumptions made at acquisition as well as other factors. The most recent impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles indicated that no adjustments were required. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and core deposit intangibles that totaled $10,577,000 and $2,178,000, respectively, at December 31 2006. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base, or the impact of changes in federal and state laws and regulations. Pension Benefits. The Company maintains a trusteed non contributory pension plan (the Plan) covering substantially all full time employees. Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the Plan. Key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates. The Company considers market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. The Company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on the building block method, which consists of aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plans asset mix. Plan assets are comprised primarily of mutual funds including bond funds, US equity funds, international equity funds, real estate funds and short term money market funds. The Company uses historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the Companys annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized to net periodic pension expense over approximately a 17 year period, which represents the expected remaining service life of the employee group. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets. These unrecognized losses will be systematically recognized as an increase in future net periodic pension expense and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended by SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). The actuarial assumptions used by the Company in determining its pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR or MSRs). Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. Capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and original loan terms (primarily 15 and 30 year). Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions. In periods of falling market interest rates, accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value. In the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future, the Company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value. When the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value, an impairment reserve must be recognized. Future changes in managements assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets, as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates, loan prepayment speeds, and other factors, could impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Companys primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Companys asset/liability management process which is governed by policies established by the Companys Boards of Directors that are reviewed and approved annually. The Board of Directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset/liability management policies to the Companys Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). In this capacity ALCO develops guidelines and strategies impacting the Companys asset/liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels/trends. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income and interest expenses associated with the Companys financial instruments also change, thereby impacting net interest income ("NII"), the primary component of the Companys earnings. ALCO utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of NII to sustained interest rate changes. While ALCO routinely monitors simulated NII sensitivity over a rolling 2 year horizon, it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk. The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet. The Company uses computer simulations to determine the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends and strategies. These simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth, loan and deposit pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics. Simulations based on numerous assumptions are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net interest income and capital. From these scenarios, interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented. Table of Contents This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for NII exposure over a 1 year horizon given both an immediate 300 basis point, or 3%, upward and downward shift in interest rates. Given the current level of interest rates, the Company has modeled an upward shift in rates of 200 basis points and a downward shift in rates of 200 basis points. Using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase 200 basis points, the December 31, 2006 earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2007 would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 7.33%. In addition, utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease 200 basis points, the December 31, 2006 earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2007 would increase by an amount equal to approximately 1.06%. Using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase 200 basis points, the December 31, 2006 earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2008 would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 4.57%. In addition, utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease 200 basis points, the December 31, 2006 earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2008 would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 6.44%. The projected results are within Companys ALCO policy limits for both years. The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including, among others, the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cashflows . The assumptions differed in each of the periods included in the sensitivity analysis above. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. The most significant factors affecting the changes in market risk exposure during 2006 compared to 2005 was the decrease in interest rates, changes in the yield curve, the shift in loan mix from indirect installment loans to commercial and commercial real estate loans, the aggregate increase in securities available for sale, the increase in total deposits, and increase in short term borrowings and the decrease in long term debt. LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk management involves the Companys ability to raise funds in order to meet its existing and anticipated financial obligations. These obligations are the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at contractual maturity, the repayment of debt as it matures, the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity may be provided through amortization, maturity or sale of assets such as loans and securities available for sale, liability sources such as increased deposits, utilization of the FHLB credit facility, purchased or other borrowed funds, and access to the capital markets. Liquidity targets are subject to change based on economic and market conditions and are controlled and monitored by ALCO. At the bank level, liquidity is managed by measuring the net amount of marketable assets after deducting pledged assets, plus lines of credit, primarily with the FHLB, which are available to fund liquidity requirements. Management then measures the adequacy of that aggregate amount relative to the aggregate amount of liabilities deemed to be sensitive or volatile. These include brokered deposits, deposits in excess of $100,000, term deposits with short maturities, and credit commitments outstanding. Additionally, the Company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to stockholders, the purchase of treasury stock, capital injections to the Bank, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are dividends from the Bank and reimbursement for services performed on behalf of the Bank. Additionally, the Company may utilize outside sources of funding such as the issuance of the trust preferred securities. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $4,554,000 during 2006.

This cash consisted of an increase in deposits of $18,562,000, an increase in repurchase agreements of $27,134,000, advances of $24,000,000 from the FHLB advances offset by the repayment of maturing FHLB advances and redemption of FHLB advances in the amount of $56,000,000. The net cash provided by operating activities totaled $5,417,000 and consisted primarily of net income of $3,215,000 and a decrease in other assets and other liabilities, net.
